I remembered the curries and stir-fry dishes were ok but nothing really memorable.

Granted, it wasn't as bad as it could have been, but in my opinion, it was unacceptable.\n\nFor one thing, there was six or seven rats packed in one cage that was, what . . . \n1' x 9\", 1 x 8\"? Don't quote me on that - I'm not 100% sure, but regardless of the details, it was way too small for the number of rats that were in it. They weren't unhealthy; they didn't look very sick, but they definitely didn't look particularly healthy, either. \n\nThe guinea pigs were what really shocked me, though. If you know anything about guinea pigs, you'll know they need a lot of space - even just for one. This cage was the same size as the rat's cage (they all were). They barely had enough to room to walk, much less exercise or popcorn (which my guinea pigs do often). There were two guinea pigs packed in that thing, when it was way, way too small for one baby guinea pig. It also didn't look that clean - all the cages, in my opinion, were grungy. The whole place felt grungy and grimy. And they obviously weren't cleaning the cages everyday, which they should be doing. It would be more unfair to the animals to do anything but at least a small cleaning each day.\n\nThe prices are, indeed, pretty good, or at least better than the prices at the Petsmart I usually go to, so there's one point for Petco. \n\nAt last, the employees. Are they nice and cheerful? Yes. That is, until you politely point out that the guinea pig cage is way too small for them to be healthy and happy (I was trying my hardest to be polite, although I could have come across as rude), they (or the one I talked to) immediately turn defensive, telling you \"it's very temporary\" and \"we take them out every night\" (which I don't believe, but maybe a Petco employee can correct me on that?) and make a face at you, not once telling you they'll tell their manager (even if they won't) or you may be right, like a good employee would.\n\nWant your customers to come back? Here's a good tip: don't tell them they're wrong about something, and rudely correct them, obviously trying to rush them out. Humor them, even if they are wrong about something.\n\nOverall, I would recommend not shopping here. They don't take good care of their pets, and their employees are rude if you care about the animals when they plainly don't. Good prices? They don't make up for that.\n\nI apologize if I made this too long, and thank you if you read all of this, regardless of whether or not you agree with me.", "type": "review", "business_id": "oqr6xovYM2BRrLojaO26Dg"}

Not...\n\nA group of eight of us show up tonight for \"dinner\" and drinks.  We get seated way the hell in the back.  I guess we didn't fit in with the rest of the crowd.  Two graphic designers, three filmmakers, a photographer and some friends.. ok?  The reason I point this out is that the waiter lets us know that this place isn't that classy of a place like LeBoca, so the people are.. well... less classy? The guy was digging himself a hole.\n\nSo we order drinks, which seem to take about 10minutes to get to our table.  In the mean time we're looking at our menu and the waiter leaves again for about 10min... he finally shows up and we order from this tiny little menu.   My girlfriend and I order some tacos and chips with guacamole, everyone else orders something a bit similar.  \n\nConversation is picking up while we wait for our food.  I see people coming and going and that's when we notice that our food is taking too damn long.  Finally after eating our small plate of chips and guacamole our food arrives. Probably about 45min later.  Here's the best part....\n\nSo the food shows up and after waiting for 45minutes, we get these tiny little tacos that look like they are from the menu of a 2 year old.  That's right.. each of the three tacos are literally two bites at most each.  Everyone eats their dinner in about 5minutes max..  pathetic.\n\nAfter our tiny little dinner, we ask for our bills..The waiter doesn't think to bring all our bills at once, no.. instead he brings one or two at a time. Guess he wants us to stick around? Who knows.. Finally the two filmmakers get their bill, pay and they leave.. couple other of our friends do the same.  My friend and I stay with our other friend who's still waiting on his bill.  He gets it and notices that his $15 meal was just charged $30 on his credit card.  He complains and the waiter vanishes for about 20minutes to fix his card.  When he comes back he gives some crap about fixing it and giving him a credit.. guess how much? Oh about 50 cents.. \n\nHe signed the slip and the remaining three of us left this crappy place.\n\nThe place actually does look pretty cool.

I am not sure if this was because the sign was not lit up or what. But, they are just 2 weeks old and maybe that hasn't been done or something. Just we aware that the sign might not be lit up when you go.\n\nVenue: It is actually kind of neat inside. There didn't seem to be any \"prime tables\" as all the tables were pretty much just 4-tops. Also, not a lot of seclusion if you are looking for that. About 40% of the venue is a bar, but isn't separated from the restaurant. Real sleek, suave bar. The kitchen is open. So, if the cook is spitting in your food then you will probably see them. I kind of liked having the open kitchen in a small venue.\n\nFood: I had the Green Chili Stew with macaroni and cheese. Go ahead, laugh at my mac & cheese. The green chili was a touch spicy but then again, I am a total spice sissy. Even with that said, it *was* good. I ate it all. \n\nThe mac and cheese was a different story. I jokingly ordered that right off the bat and our server raved about it. Said he loved it. My guest also ordered it. Without a doubt, the mac and cheese was awesome. Really, I think it was better than my green chili stew.\n\nCost: It cost us $48 for two people. This was with 2 mains, 2 sides, an iced-tea, and an alcoholic beverage. Not bad.\n\nBottom Line: I see this place succeeding... especially if people can find it with their light off outside.", "type": "review", "business_id": "I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ"}

It was significantly smaller than the sandwich places I normally go to. So I ignored the size and dove in. WOW! The bread was so good. Toasted without being dry, light. The meat was perfectly cooked, not chewy like the last sandwich I ordered at another place, the coleslaw was so good and flavorful, juicy without dripping all over the place. The chips were also really good! Now the sandwich was smaller than I am used to but it wound up being the perfect size. It was so good I can't wait to go back!", "type": "review", "business_id": "yA9gOueRPoQ4-Y8Xdu8k3Q"}

Brand new state of the art facility, so I'm assuming thats what your paying for at the ticket counter. A bit pricey if you ask me but the gift shop was actually reasonable so thats a wash in my book.....\n\nWe were just in time to catch a 3D documentary on the flight & life of a monarch butterfly. I've seen this before on the tele but it was pretty cool in 3D. Then from there we went into this staging room before the atrium were we got to see several different types of butterflies emerging from their cocoons. Pretty cool! This place is great because there is no rush, it's all at your own speed. After watching butterflies break out of their cocoons we were off to the atrium. a butterfly haven. NO TOUCHING, NO PICKING UP but if they land on you thats ok. Hard for a little girl to grasp so I had to keep reminding her. Trust me when I say the butterfly keepers are on it too! The only thing I don't like about this experience is Summer, it was nice and toasty in there and the humidity was off the charts. From there tho you can cool down in the snack shop before you continue on.....\n\nThe next area is about insects & fish. Really good displays of both & a shallow tank with sting rays in them for petting. Not as spectacle as sea world but worth saving yourself a 5 hour drive over. You make your way thru the gift shop and after that your at the entrance/exit, round 2-sure, there's no time limit, how great! \n\nMy recommendations is try enjoying this place in better weather, you'll get your monies worth for sure being able to stay longer.

Plate lunch is a term that us locals like to call our plates from a bbq or local eatery. A normal plate that you can get from ONO Hawaiian BBQ, L&L BBQ, or any other hawaiian places is that every entree comes with rice and mac salad. But Korean style plate lunches come with rice and 4 sides like mac salad, kimchee, cucumber kimchee, noodles, corn, salad, and seaweed plus a few other choices. Thas the key difference and so far this is the only place I have found this.\n\nI like this place the most compared to any other Hawaiian bbq spot out here is that they serve Meat jun and the sides.  Meat Jun is thinly sliced marinated beef that is egg battered, then pan fried, and served with a slightly spicy sauce. It is also a Korean entree that originated from Hawaii so don't really expect to find this at any other Korean restaurants.\n\nI recommend people to try this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "i_H_yKtISROjQ4eruSwyPw"}

Front door was wide open. Nice little place - got seated immediately and attended to by a fairly nice waitress. Imagine my surprise when I checked the menu and saw Vietnamese pho! I'm a big fan, and while I was guessing it wouldn't be up to par with more centrally-located places like Pho Thanh I decided to give it a shot. The wife had massaman curry which she asked to be made quite spicy (\"Thai Hot\" as they call it). My pho, as predicted, wasn't that great. The meat was cut into thick chunks and the broth was actually sweet! I called one of the servers over and asked about it - they said that the cook was used to Thai dishes and had put a little too much sugar in as that's the norm with other stuff like the satay sauce etc. Fair enough, like I said I was expecting it. Taste aside, it wasn't a huge bowl and it was $10 - very much overpriced. I honestly don't know why I got it at a Thai restaurant, I suppose it's just because I like it so much that when I saw it on the menu my eyes glazed over. Like getting a burger at a Dairy Queen or something? (shrug) Anyways, the wife thoroughly enjoyed her curry - quite spicy but not too spicy for her. Note that she was charged an extra $1 for brown rice - a little too nickel-and-dimey for my liking. My kid had his usual chicken satay sticks. The chicken was dry and leathery, so marks dropped for that. Decor was nice, menu was done very well (see my photo).\n\nAll in all a fairly average experience. We'll be back to check out other dishes (Thai ones! *8-) and to support this new local business, but these folk certainly have a lot of catching up to do before they draw level with Line Thai in Sun City and (so far) wouldn't be our first choice for lunch or dinner going forward if we were starving.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_K5cfCM7-zQZ1hXdbsc2fQ"}

We all arrived at 7:45 pm and or table was ready and waiting for us. The place was pretty packed for a Thursday night. \n\nAs soon as we sat down we were served chips and salsa then our waiter came to our table and took our drink orders.\n\nI have three standards when it comes to judging Mexican restaurants beans, rice and salsa. These three items will tell you whether or not you are in a quality Mexican restaurant. Thankfully, all three passed my test. \n\n(1) The salsa- The salsa here is to die for. WARNING: The chips & salsa here is addicting. I could make a meal out of their salsa and chips they were so awesome. The chips were crispy, tasty served hot and so fresh. Their salsa adds a zing to anything you put it on. The best part is they are FREE with an entr\u00e9e .\n(2) Beans- the beans was cooked to perfection. They were very tasteful.\n(3) Rice - was cooked perfectly. They tasted homemade. \n\nAll ten people got something different. By the silence during dinner they all enjoyed their meals. Afterwards everyone commented how they ate to much chis and salsa because they were so good and how delicious everything was.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I went against my usual instincts and ordered something new and different. I got the  Carne Macha (Shredded beef saut\u00e9ed with fresh tomatoes, onions, green bell peppers, and a special seasoning. Served with guacamole, rice, beans and choice of corn or flour tortillas). The Macha beef was overdone, dried out and looked burnt. I ate everything except the beef. Thank goodness I had chips & salsa to fill me up. I told our waiter how disappointed I was with the beef and pointed out I ate everything else. He offered to get me something different. I declined because everyone else was just finishing their meals. Later he took the meal off the bill.\n\nThe atmosphere is very festive and vibrant. The only thing keeping me from granting a 4 star rating is my meal was not to my liking. If my meal was expectable / enjoyable I would have given it a rating of 4. \n\nFOOD: The portions were ample so if you're a big eater you'll be pleased. They use fresh ingredients and their entrees look very inviting. Salsa and chips (complementary) is praiseworthy. Flavorfully spiced with a nice consistency, I wanted to take home a 5 gallon bucket of this stuff. The rice here is perfect!  AMBIANCE: The restaurant is really interesting to look at. You can tell that the owners take great pride in the restaurant.  They took the time to nicely decorate the restaurant although the d\u00e9cor is what you'd expect in a Mexican restaurant.  PRICE: Average for a quality Mexican restaurant. SERVICE: Our waiter and his helper were both very friendly attentive and efficient . CONCLUSION: characteristic d\u00e9cor. The atmosphere is great. Portions are big.  I enjoyed this place -- food, price, service, atmosphere -- everything you'd want.  Highly recommended  RETURN  FACTOR: 100%.\n\n    ***************** What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT", "type": "review", "business_id": "I7IfnWW1nXljC4ZGqwPe-w"}

Two dishes, a rice and two naans was enough food for three plus enough leftover for a fourth diner.  So even though the prices are a bite high, it works out in the end.\n\nMango Lassi - creamy and refreshing, not too sweet\nChicken Masala - sauce was a little thick but well spiced\nMalai Kofta - sauce was a better consistency but was not a fan of the homemade cheese balls\nPeas Pulaou - ok\nPlain and Garlic Naan - both good but the garlic one kicks it up a notch.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_RBUU1y4yJrK0SPAd8z0-w"}

I was excited, it included tasty food from all of the Fairmont's restaurants. But after the experience I had I won't be back. I was under the impression that this was a world class resort, however the service we received in the restaurant was below what I would expect at Applebee's. Don't get me wrong, the property is beautiful. The valet's were friendly and helpful, providing us directions to the LV Bistro where brunch was held. The hostess was friendly, quickly found or reservation and we were directed to our table, where we sat and waited to be greeted by our server for our drink order. \nWe waited, and waited. 15 minutes after we were sat, a woman approached us and asked if we were waiting another to join our party as she began filling a water glass. We told her were weren't, and we had been waiting for a while. She quickly turned and disappeared, leaving a half filled water glass (and water spilled on the table) behind. Another 5 minutes later a server with a tray of drinks appeared and told us he would be right with us. He dropped off the drinks and greeted a table that was just sat. A few more minutes passed and a female server greeted us and began taking out drink order and giving us the lay of the buffet when the male server returned to see if we needed anything else. Once we got our drinks, and found the buffet things went somewhat smoother. During this time we realized how cold we were. It was about 62 degrees when we arrived and the doors of the dinning room were wide open to the buffet outside. Those seated outside got space heaters, but inside we got sweeping breezes. Not what I would expect from this type of setting. \nI would be much more understanding if the restaurant was busy, but when we got there at noon, it wasn't. In fact, countless staff members wandered around the floor, diverting their gazes from our hungry and confused stares. I wanted to alert the hostess to the situation, but was asked not to by my companions. I have been a server, so I am understanding, but this was ridiculous. It's a buffet, we only needed to be greeted, and get drinks. There is no reason we should have had to wait 25 minutes to be greeted. I was seriously shocked that the manager and hostess making their way past us repeatedly failed to notice this either. I expected a wonderful experience, and while the food was good the overall experience fell short. I didn't feel that it was worth the $70 price to be neglected and freeze.", "type": "review", "business_id": "9mfec4ySQpW8doGs3FUP2Q"}

They have a beautiful relaxation room where you can lay down with cuddly blankets and read, take a nap, or eat some yummy snack mixes that are laid out.  It has a steam room and sauna, and awesome showers with showerheads everywhere.  There is also a little outdoor private area with jacuzzi and outdoor showers.\n\nI had a stone massage, which I hoped would never end.  When you walk into the room, they give you a choice of around 5 different mixes to listen to on their ipod depending on your mood.  I thought that was pretty cool too.  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  I wish I could have had more time to use the gym there too, that looked really nice also.  I would highly recommend spending a day at this spa.

We sit outside in the sun, which was hot but ok since we are inside all day anyway. Our waitress comes by and doesn't introduce herself or even say hi. She was very monotone and seemed like she was just mad at the day. I know it happens, we all go through those moments or days, but even when I was pissed or tired as a waitress, I was pleasant because I knew this was how I was going to make my money.\n\nSo she takes our order. I order the turkey sandwich special and my friend orders the chicken with taziki (sp?). Pretty simple stuff. Well we wait....and wait....and wait...and see people get their food who sat down and ordered after us....and we wait some more. She didn't bother to come out and talk to us or give us any info, updates or apologies but only when she checked on another table did she realize that we didn't have our food yet and had gone through two drinks each already. I know things happen, when you're busy things aren't ordered....anyone in the serving business has done it, but its how you handle it after the fact that matters. Never once did we get an apology or anything!\n\nWhen we finally got our food, my \"toasted\" sandwich was cold and the \"hot\" potatoes that came with it were cold as well. Unfortunately it was one of those situations where 1. I didn't want to be that customer despite the overwhelming feeling that I should be, and 2. I was too hungry and had waited FAR too long to wait any longer and we needed to get back to work.\n\nThe couple next to us as well as my friend received dirty glasses with lipstick stains and detergent on them- which again, happens but it just added fuel to the fire. \n\nMy food was only OK despite knowing that Pita Jungle can serve up way better than what they gave us this time around.

I found it instantly comforting instead of cramped quickly. \n\nYou have a hostess area right when you enter. I checked out the lounge to the right and it had about three or four major seating areas along with some tables-but the people sitting there looked way comfortable and they weren't about to leave anytime soon.\n\nWe went to the left and there were high tables and stools set up. Along the wall were large cushioned backs for loungers on the plush cushion. I opted for the stool and it was surprisingly fine-most stools for shorties make me feel weird since my feet are dangling. The rest of the space had more high tables and then a smaller bar area with stools. There was plenty of seating, and while it wasn't packed, everyone there looked like they were with friends or established dates and totally relaxed having drinks-I didn't feel any meat market here.\n\nI was disappointed by the wine by the glass selection (not the highest caliber-hence the minus start) so I stuck with the martini selection. Most 'tinis don't go under 7.50 but they also don't go over 10-pretty reasonable. The waiter was very down to earth and told me the truth about buying cigarettes-that the bar down the street would have them and be like 7.50-no thanks! So mad props to him for the low down.\n\nWe got the Summer Peach, the S'mores, Afternoon Delight, and Raspberry \"\" (blanking out on drink name-sorry!). They fill their drinks to the brim and they are pretty damn strong. The peach one was refreshing and not overtly sweet-much like a belletini. The raspberry was like a popsicle...an ADULT popsicle-a bit too sweet for me but had real raspberries on the bottom. The afternoon was a personal favourite of mine-citrusy but not too sweet, I'll def. get this drink next time. The s'mores was out of control-graham cracker crust? An actual marshmellow in it? Whoa.

Saturday is usually the most busy day for every dim sum places. The restaurant is pretty empty out. \n\nWe sat down and order 5 dishes. That's where the problem came. I don't like to be treated like moron. Why there is 6 dishes marked on the sheet? \n\nWe kindly asked manager to check it out. Long story short, they turn into deny mode. And finally removed the extra marked item we never ordered without offering any apology and sorry. Mistake does happen, but don't pretend that you don't know it. Admit it. The portion of the dishes are also shrinking. With the price and services, I can find better dim sum place. Yes. I am really picky on the food quality and service. \n\nFool me once is enough.

Now with that said my wife and I have been to a few of the joints showcased on that show.  As many of you that have started this journey like we have you find killer places and some okay places.  Matt's is a KILLER place.\n\nMy wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning.  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge.  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spots.\n\nThe food is awesome!!  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning! \n\nHere is what we had:\n\nPork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries, side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly.  The pork chop is to die for.  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed.  Not at Matt's, it was tender and cooked perfectly.  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven!  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually.  This bacon would make anything taste great!  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage, fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble.  Once again cooked perfect, not greasy at all but with big flavor.  We both had home fries which were incredible.  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions.  Pretty close to perfect!\n\nThe next day my wife had the waffle, which she liked.  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish.  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm).  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak, eggs and hash browns.  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often).  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely.  The hash browns were very nice.  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle.  Exactly what you would hope for.  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly.  It was like butter!!!  Nothing like your store bought jelly.  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both mornings!!!\n\nAs for the service it was pretty good.  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant.  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad.  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon.  Very nice touch!\n\nOverall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants breakfast cooked the way it should be!", "type": "review", "business_id": "ntN85eu27C04nwyPa8IHtw"}

Instead, I had their chicken caesar salad. Good lord I'd died and gone to heaven with a dish like that...not too much dressing, tons of leafy lettuce and chicken that was cooked just right!\n\nWe loved the idea of the pews. I liked it because it reminded me of being back in Scotland. :D\n\nService rocked it! Friendly and kick ass, prompt! They are making me fall in love with them.\n\nA month later, I take hubby there...I order the same thing...and am massively disappointed. The lettuce is wilted, chicken is the best part of the salad and sadly, there is so much dressing I was distraught.\n\nAgain, service rocked it...but hubby was most impressed with the happy hour prices of the beers and the size...and the selection. He wasn't happy with is pasty which was ok by my standards.\n\nToday I had a craving for a pasty. Hopped over there and had their chicken tikka. It was aight. Nothing to make me do cartwheels or dance on the tables. Ok, if I danced on the tables, I'd really be embarrassed because my ass would break it. I'm sure of it.\n\nAnyway, I'll give this place another whirl next month and see how it goes.

The office people intentionally mislead us about the security insurance policy - it is not the equivalent of a security deposit - so that when we left we owed them a ton of cash because they claimed that we ruined their crappy shag carpet.  No amount of contact with the local office staff or their corporate overlords ever rectified the situation, so we paid the fee to avoid having a blemish on our renting history.  I regularly curse at the building as I'm going by the convenient location.\n\nI would never recommend this complex to anyone, but my friend, who was my roommate at the time that we lived at Camden, decided to give them another try.  Cell phone reception is still horrible, he has to leave his phone on the window sill.  His $800-a-month one-bedroom turned into nearly $1000 per month due to all of their mandatory fees.  Fees include valet garbage even though he has to walk by a dumpster to get to his car, mandatory $45 basic cable and so on.

We were seated a one of the oversized wooden four tops overlooking the patio from one side and peering into the kitchen from the opposite. I was facing the kitchen and enjoyed watching the action and seeing all the enticing entrees and apps coming out. It was also cool to see Chef Eddie doing his thing back there and working just as hard as any of his employees. The decor of the place reminded me of a southern country club: dark, rich colors, nice but not pretentious, and comfortable.\n\nWe started with two orders of the Mo'rockin shrimp, one per couple because they were so highly touted. After my first bite I was so thankful we had done so. First,they tasted incredible!!! So many flavors in one bite- I could lick the plate and die happy! Second, there are only four shrimp per order and no one deserves only one bite of those delicious little morsels. I questioned the biscuit balls at first glance but after splitting one in half and sopping up the remaining sauce on the plate I understood how tasty and functional they were. \n\nMy side of the table split a Caesar  salad that had great dressing but was a tad hard to eat for me because it was not chopped. I made lots of noise chopping it myself, but still managed to make it work. My other half was not pleased with the chopped olives sprinkled on top, but I liked the extra favor acidity they added. \n\nFor dinner I had the whole portion of sea bass and it was literally perfect. I can't say I have ever had better. It was served with some gorgeous and just as tasty broccolini. Sharing is a common occurrence among the four diners who were present, so I got to taste a little bit of everyone's! My guy had \"what's in my steak\",  which looked like a giant edible softball on a plate, but tasted like a big sweet hug from grandma! Comfort food extraordinaire!  It reminded me of something Willy Wonka would make. Crazy looking but scrum-diddily-umptious! The tuna and halibut from \"east meets west \" were both excellent, and the golden beet slices that accompanied the scallops were delish. \n\nFinally, for dessert the birthday boy in our group chose the \"chocolate pot du creme\". Holy mother of all that is chocolate! This was amazing!! It looked and tasted like liquid fudge. It was incredibly rich and decadent and perfect to share. \n\nAll of this deliciousness, accompanied by two bottles of La Crema Chardonnay,  plus my lovely dining companions equalled a five star review and a lasting memory of a wonderful night.", "type": "review", "business_id": "He9Dar4bk2vyeiPC7TkUgA"}

We were seated, and started with the pork belly and burrata mozzarella.  Pork belly is very fatty - and I'm never prepared for it - so it always catches me off guard.  But it was nice with the lentils.  The fresh mozzarella was really good with the tomatoes.  For the entree, Angie got the salmon and I got the flatiron.  The salmon was on a nice orzo salad and really felt like a complete meal.  The skirt steak was more of a de-constructed steak salad.  The arugula with parmesan was good, and the steak was seasoned nicely, but the meal just left me wanting more if that makes sense.  Maybe a starch would help complete the dish, but as is I wouldn't consider it an entree.  The desserts were just ok, I had the gelato trio and the pistachio one was tasty but the rest were just forgettable.

Reyes de la Torta will do it. \n\nI had always heard about this place from the youth I worked with. They said it was amazing. Once I went, I was hooked. \n\nYou're going to get a completely different feel from this place. Yeah, it's in a strip mall; yeah, the hostess may stick you and your party at a table smaller than you're accustomed to; Yeah, there is soccer playing on the TVs instead of the news; .. but the food will make you not care about any of those things. Plus, they are always playing Salsa, not loud or rambunctious, trumpet-filled music. This adds to the experience as it makes me feel like I may be somewhere resembling my homeland of Colombia. \n\nWhen you're asked for your drink order, make sure you ask for one of their aguas frescas... translation: fresh juice. I always get the Agua Fresca de Limon. It reminds me of the limeade I drink when I am back home in Colombia - this drink makes the whole experience worth it.  The chips and salsa are good, although you might want to watch out with the salsa if you're not a spice fan. \n\nOk, the restaurant is named the king of the tortas ... and you ask what is a torta?? To Mexican people, a torta is sandwich of meat, vegetables and anything else they may throw on there made on a hamburger-style bun - and that is what they're famous for -  that is why Adam from Man vs Food went there. But, I have never had their tortas simply because at Reyes you will enter a homemade-tortilla heaven that is like nothing else. These tortillas are amazing, from their texture, to their slight greasiness, to their taste, they are the best tortillas I have ever had. \n\nSo, in order to continue to eat the best tortillas ever, I always get the chicken quesadilla. Yep, it's simple, but amazing. You can also choose to get it \"Estilo del Rey\" which means they top off your quesadilla with more cheese ( white cheese, not crappy, yellow, greasy cheese), sour cream and green onions. That in itself sends this quesadilla into the history books. \n\nDo yourself a favor and check out a truly unique restaurant tucked away in a strip mall just south of Hatcher on 7th Street.

I order a BURRITO, with MEAT.  I have eaten at over FOUR Chipotles, which basically makes me an expert of Chipotle, burritos, and all food in general.\n\nOne of the greatest things about Chipotle is consistency; you can walk into a Chipotle in anywhere in the world and you know that your food is going to be fresh and delicious.  What you don't necessarily know though, is the attitude.  Is this a Chipotle where everyone is happy and burritos are being tossed joyously from one person to another in celebration of food preparation?  Or is this Chipotle run by a dirty, filthy man who hates you simply for being alive, and will follow you out to your car and mug you?  Nobody knows.  Except me, because I've eaten at this one several times.\n\nThis is a magnificent Chipotle.  The people are good spirited, helpfully construct your burrito quickly, and pleasantly.  Sometimes I go into this Chipotle and I'm like, \"Eh, not having such a great day - maybe a burrito will make me happy\" and do you know what?  I go into this place, and everybody is happy and working and it's like, \"Yeah... yeah now I'm feeling a little better.  Maybe things aren't so bad.  Maybe she still loves me.\"\n\nSo to summarize, this is a great Chipotle.  It's bright, friendly, ample parking, and the same fresh and delicious ingredients you expect.", "type": "review", "business_id": "R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q"}

We than moved  on to the spicy tuna roll, which is made just with Sriracha and doesn't have any mayonnaise to mask the flavor of the fish.  We had a few more orders of hamachi and then ordered the \"Snow White\" roll, (a daily special) which was the spicy tuna roll with white tuna on top and garnished with a dab of Sriracha on top. It was excellent!  We then asked the sushi chef for his recommendation and he made us an order of albacore tuna sushi with a miso mustard sauce on it.  What an incredible presentation!  We immediately ordered another order.  Overall, the cuts of sushi were very meaty and everything was incredibly fresh. \n\nThe atmosphere was slightly lacking, but the sushi chef (owner) told us that he was in the process of ramping up and had already ordered a large fish tank to go on one wall and was planning to re-do the paper lanterns with hanging lights.  He also told us that he's been in the U.S. for 18 years now and finally has his own restaurant after starting out as a dish washer (kudos to him!) and that he can't believe how his competitors will serve day old fish.  \n\nI think we've found our new North Scottsdale go-to sushi place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "nKrK1aK2uWtL57Q3ShH6Hg"}

I plan on trying Marcella's for lunch and/or dinner in the near future, so I'll update once I do.\n\nWhen I heard Marcella's was opening at Fashion Square, I was so excited. Marcella's originated in Columbus, Ohio, and there are two locations there. My Ohio friends rave all the time about Marcella's -now that it is here in Scottsdale, I finally could find out what all the buzz was about.\n\nMarcella's is located next to Modern Steak and is in the new Barney's wing. Parking is available in the lot across from Grand Lux, and if there are no open spots, in the evening you can park in the underground garage. I met a friend who moved here from Columbus for happy hour last Wednesday night. I arrived first and secured us two spots at the outside bar. Our bartender, Josh (I am pretty sure that was his name), was a sweetheart and chatted with us quite a bit and provided excellent service.\n\nMy friend had the red sangria which she really enjoyed while I stuck with Stella Artois. As a note, the beers on draft are Peroni or Stella. No cheapo American beers here on draft thankfully. For food, we had the zucchini, garlic cheese bread, and the pesto shrimp pizza. All the food was really good, especially the pizza. The food was great, but what is even better are the happy hour prices! The appetizers range from $2.25 to $4.95, while the pizzas will run you from $4.95 to $6.50. Beer and sangria are $3, wine by the glass is half off, and martinis and specialty cocktails are $5. Plus happy hour runs from 3-7 pm, so working people can actually make it and enjoy a few drinks. Marcella's definitely has the best happy hour deal in town now that it is open!\n\nI can't wait to go back to try more of the appetizers and to have a full meal.

Most of the menu ranges from mediocre/uninteresting to genuinely bad. It took me awhile to find something I liked here (came back because my friends loved it). There are some obvious staples that you can't go wrong with  like cheese quesadillas, ground beef tacos, etc. The cheese quesadillas especially are amazing as a simple item almost everyone would like, and although they can be expensive (not counting the $1.19 jr. quesadillas on friday!), it's only because they're huge!\n\nBut the best thing at FiliB's, to me, is the Arizona burrito drenched in hot sauce. Their hot sauce is amazing by the way. Most of their steak-based burritos are great. Carne Asada, AZ, California. Their fish tacos and shrimp burritos are great too, though a little pricey. So yeah, generally, Filiberto's has some great greasy fast food if you know what to order.\n\nThe reason this only gets 2 stars though, is that even the \"good\" food here is pretty bad. I don't know what it is about this location, if their employees don't know how to work a grill or if they use worse ingredients, but their food is consistently worse than other locations (specifically the one on Guadalupe and McClintock, which is always amazing and has free chips too!). But the cheese in the burritos consistently comes completely unmelted, the meat in them is always weirdly textured, and the employees clearly don't give a shit about helping you at all.\n\nAnd not that it really matters that much, but the interior of this place is kind of a shit-hole. I've seen worse in this chain, but I've seen much better as well.\n\nOverall: I go to this place because it's the closest filiberto's to me and sometimes I crave it.

You have not lived until you've tried this stuff! It's cooked in a buttery miso glaze that compliments the fish perfectly. I've had black cod and butterfish at other restaurants, but nothing has ever come close to the black cod at Yasu. This is a melt-in-your-mouth, little-slice-of-heaven kind of treat.

My son only wanted a cheese crisp and the kids combo (which isn't much of a combo only one side and no drink included) was 4.75 and when I asked the price for just a Kids cheese crisp the waiter said it was going to 5.95. He said that there is no option to have the kids crisp by itself, they give you the adult size app crisp instead and charge full price.

This place reminds me of a narrow cave that happens to have a long bar with about 18 stools, six larger booths that can fit five patrons comfortably, four table tops, and three double occupancy booths. The bar is pretty cool, its lined with red lights and has eight rather large flat screen TVs you can see from the stools and the larger booths that we were seated at. I opted for the Sweet and Spicy burger ($12), thanks to Yelp, and my mom went with a plain ole cheeseburger ($11). Knowing that the burgers do not come with anything, we decided to order the sweet potato fries ($5) and both got iced teas ($2.5 each). My burger was delicious and was everything the title said it would be...sweet and spicy thanks to the sweet glazed jalapenos. I also enjoyed the crunchy, deep fried ratatouille, yum. My mom wasn't impressed with her simple cheeseburger and said she would order mine if she were to come back and we both enjoyed sharing the sweet potato fries.\n\nBrent, our server, did a great job with suggestions and service. As lunch time got more busy and he got more tables he was always checking in with us and even put our iced teas in to-go cups. This place was, as the default Yelp display states, a-ok.  I'm glad I tried The Grind, but probably wouldn't suggest this place for lunch, but wouldn't hesitate to come back here if it is suggested by friends.\n\nBreakdown:\n\none star for being a narrow cave\none star for the Sweet and Spicy Burger   -and-\none star for Brent, our awesome waiter.", "type": "review", "business_id": "r-a-Cn9hxdEnYTtVTB5bMQ"}

Another 10 mins. and a waitress asked about drinks and we ordered a bottle of wine and menus.

They are consistently decent, rarely outstanding.  If I want outstanding, there are non-chain restaurants that can fill that need.\n\nBut today was different.  We went there for Sunday lunch, party of six, and although it overall went well, it was one of the very rare occasions where my meal was screwed up.  I had a steak off the menu, and since their web site sucks and I can't pull down a menu and find the actual name, I can't name it.  But it had a parm sauce with bread crumbs, came with balsamic drizzled asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.  The waitress asked if I wanted it medium or medium well, I ordered medium well.  A straight-forward order, nothing custom.\n\nEveryone's food came out, albeit slowly, and I started sawing through my meat.  And I mean saw.  It was tremendously over-done.  I sent it back.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Not only had everyone else finished their meals while I waited, but one couple had to leave.  My remake arrived, delivered by the manager, and I stuck my fork in to it and found it was not over-done.  First bite was great, then my wife commented that it was bleeding.  I know the juice is not blood, but it was very rare, well below medium-well.  I cut another piece and noticed something odd, so I scraped the toppings off and found that the cook (I will not use the term chef since they could not properly cook a small steak) had cut in to the meat to see how done it was, then covered it up with topping.  If they saw it was under-done, why didn't they just continue to cook it?\n\nSo I asked again for the manager and explained the situation.  She was very apologetic and It was taken off the bill, a substitution was offered but everyone else was done and I didn't want to detail the other three.  So aside from salad and two breadsticks, my lunch was balsamic-drizzled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nMy wife theorized a possible explanation.  Since I did not actually send the original plate back, they couldn't see how over-done my original was, and they deliberately under-cooked the replacement.  Perhaps if I'd actually sent the plate back they would have seen it wasn't correct.\n\nTo be fair, everyone else's meal was fine.  But I would suggest that if you order steak at this Olive Garden, make sure it is done properly.", "type": "review", "business_id": "OIBrslaVxFxaaGUsYFUujg"}

Which I find preposterous.  Would they have a list judging the best movie about grass growing?  \"In the end, Crabgrass beat out Ragweed just because of the potential allergens.\"\n\nNo, because sometimes you can make an entire category of things that suck, and chain restaurants, as a general rule, serve shitty steak. Not that I'm judging.\n\nSo if you go to Outback, don't expect anything amazing, despite the fact that zagat said they were tasty.  But outback is worth visiting anyway, because have you ever had their shrimp appetizer served on their brown bread garlic slab-thing?  The bread is better than the shrimp.  It's amazing.\n\nBut truly legendary status is only accorded thusly: imagine an appetizer with so many calories that three could share and still crack a thousand calories each?  Enter the cheese fries with bacon and a glob of ranch and you will know what spoonfuls of lard feel like to your arteries.  This particular location has a number of great bartenders and if you go there looking for a pleasant time and decent food, you'll be satisfied.  Chicken breast with BBQ sauce: palatable.  Broccoli with crab-butter sauce?  Tasty.  Rack of lamb? Surprisingly good.  Really there are a ton of options here but one thing you will not get is world-beating steak.

The place is marijuana-themed. I thought this was cute the first time I came here, since I'm from California, where it's virtually legal, and this was in Arizona, where Pot hadn't been legalized yet. (Although, the girl who made my food told me that AZ has recently legalized medicinal herbs, but that's a whole different story and review.)\n\nThe bread they use is baked fresh every day in a nearby bakery. Their ingredients are better than Subway or Quizno's, and their prices are moderately high, but well under 10 dollars, and completely worth it. Everything on the menu shares a name with a strain of marijuana, or something from pot culture. I liked that they're permanently unable to supply a sandwich known as \"Schwag,\" and their pork sandwich is called a 5-0.\n\nOther points of interest are their photos of Chong eating there, Kool-Aid on tap next to their soda fountains, and a huge mural covering a wall and a half depicting what appears to be Adam and Eve smoking blunts in Eden. Of course, there are stickers everywhere, flyers for raves and parties near the sandwich prep area, and really friendly staff. I honestly can't find anything wrong with this place, other than the fact that they're a lot harder to find outside of Arizona.\n\nThese are honestly among the best sandwiches I've ever eaten at a restaurant.

The portions are very very small and the prices are very very high. The wait staff is great, sometimes they forget things and need to ask them a few times but they eventually bring you the things you ask for.  The menu has changed since last time we came.  Was happy to see they have a few more apps, we did not get any as the waitress told us they were really small plates and not enough to share for the family - so we passed.  Also please beware the menu does not list all the ingredients in the food so if you have allergies please ask - for instance I really was looking forward to trying the Mac & Cheese,  I have had Mac & Cheese everywhere nothing was listed on the menu except Mac & Cheese which was the worse I have ever tasted.  Plus they put hot peppers and bacon it in, for me since I do not like pork when I ordered just plain Mac & Cheese I should have gotten it but they added stuff which is not listed on the menu which is why only a 3 star rating.\nThe price of the 6oz elk is a little high especially since a pound of elk sells for less than ten dollars so them charging close to forty for 6 oz does not make much sense money wise.  The decor is nice, some of the tables are way to close to together and you can feel like a sardine when it gets crowded.  I like sitting in the the small room with the fireplace better than the outside larger rooms it was a little nicer.\nThe tap water they put in the glasses is disgusting tasting, opt for the fuji bottled water. All the menus items can be changed to your liking so if you wanted something different you can get it sometimes without a charge sometimes with a charge.  All in All in was a delicious meal with just one or two problems and the food was good, the amount of food and the problem with the Mac & Cheese plus no one was willing to make an accommodation for the problem with the Mac & Cheese and I told two wait staff and my waiter and still nothing.

The sandwich had bacon turkey on a tomato bread. The tomato bread was interesting. They actually seemed to understand the rules of sandwich making. Which are :\n\n-Soft fillings should be served on soft breads.\n-Make sure there's a moisture barrier (i.e., something creamy or oily) between your -bread and wet ingredients (e.g., tomatoes).\n-Keep slippery ingredients away from each other.\n-Use a bread you'd be willing to eat on its own.\n \nThese are rather simple rules, but you would be surprised how often places don't understand them, and you get these sandwiches that one bite caused everything to poop out the back. The point of a sandwich is supposed to be that you can eat it easily while doing other things and not had stuff all over your hands. If the sandwich can't do that, it has failed in it's purpose of sandwichness!!! \n\nThe sandwich was almost made quickly and efficiently.

F&E's ready-made meal selections are pretty extensive AND are very yummy.  I freeze them too, they keep just as well in the freezer for about a week.  Not sure if I'm breaking any rules by doing that, but whoopie it works for me! \n\nI love love love their Greek yogurt.  I'm pretty sure that F&E yogurt is NOT healthy, can't be.  Nothing that tastes that darn good could be.  It takes 45+ minutes to cook brown rice, the fresh and easy ready-made brown rice is fantastically delicious AND takes 90 seconds to prepare.\n\nI shop around and I also find that prices in F&E are often cheaper than they are at the big box stores, especially Fry's.  \n\nThis store is always clean and is a great place to pick up your groceries.", "type": "review", "business_id": "thlCF7B2DIhkOuyQXj6liw"}

Not like this place is still a secret, which is a good thing because hopefully that means it's not going anywhere. \n\nI should mention that I can't normally eat a lot of food in one sitting. But something magical happens to my stomach when I walk into Carolina's. I'm suddenly able to put away twice the amount of food as my male dining companions. The problem is, I can't ever decide whether to get the bean and cheese burrito or the red machaca burrito, so I just end up getting both. And finishing both. And it's not even difficult! \n\nThese have to be two of the best burritos in the history of the world, and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the ridiculously delicious tortillas they make here. I always pick up a dozen to take back with me to NYC, just to show people here that good Mexican DOES exist! It's just all, sadly, located in slightly shady parts of Phoenix (or in SoCal, or in actual Mexico). \n\nThe wait to order is never very long, but the wait to get your food does seem endless. It's only because they make everything fresh to order, though! And it probably just feels like an eternity because I've really been waiting several MONTHS to eat this food, and that's just added to the 5-10 minute wait for the food to arrive. \n\nThey have something here that I have never seen before...a Coke fountain AND a Pepsi fountain! And a smaller fountain with ok-tasting horchata and other Mexican refrescas. So no more fighting over whether a place is Coke or Pepsi, they've got it all covered. \n\nI could probably write several essays' worth of love for this place, but I'll save you all the time-just get off your butt and get to Carolina's ASAP! And if you're heading to NYC, bring me some tortillas! :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "d52zg-S0o940WUCK-nNiKw"}

They also doused the entire thing with about a quart of Russian Dressing (#5), put some fancy tomatoes on the sandwich and I requested a change of cheese from baby swiss to Smoked cheddar. You can only get about 8 different cheeses here on your sandwich (the rest you must buy) and they only carry one style of Boars Head turkey. No pepper or pastrami style, nothing but boring old plain turkey. Whoever is raving about the macaroni salad must be a rookie as well. The mac salad lacked any flavor and resembled ones you will find in a supermarket tub. There might be some better sandwich combinations out there on their extremly cluttered back wall (it's actually not cute cause your menu is in 20 places), but with the limited variety of meats, it doesn't mean much.

In this case we did not use priceline- just a group code so we were in the very corner of the terrace building with a view of the street.  The room was nice and the bed very comfortable, there were quite a few stains on the carpet though and my standard bathtub at home is larger than the tub in the room.\n\nI think priceline and the rooms at the local casinos have spoiled me!

There are a lot of pools on the property, I thought the Catalina pool which is all tile was the coolest, it has a fountain that separates the kid's side which is shallow (think 50's).  The front desk said they call it the Marilyn Monroe pool because she always said that it was her favorite pool in the whole world.\n\nOther posters mentioned tours but we were not advised of one.  We went to the concierge and told them we wanted to learn more about this fabulous property so gave us a map and told us to wander, they even let us go into the \"history room\" which is a 2 story meeting room located on the 3rd floor with all of the history of the building of the property we thought that was the coolest! \n\nThe reunion was on the golf course next to the pro shop.

Many of us were wearing 18th century french aristocrat costumes and were jovial, extremely high spirited, and looking forward to going into an event being held at this bar. Upon arrival, the patio-onlookers immediately began to try to get photos with us, the people at the door, and even security were cracking up and excited for us to be a part of their evening. This particular event had a relatively high cover price for some of our party-goers, and being that we were going to make up for any type of cover in many birthday drinks (we had spent an average of over $100 at each bar we went to this night), we felt it appropriate to simply ask if waiving the cover for out party would be alright. \n\nHere is where the first mistake was made - the door people claimed this \"had to be brought to the attention of the manager\". As a promoter myself, if a group of this many people come to your event together (especially those with particularly colorful personalities), you simply encourage their patronage in any way possible. 12 people have a lot of friends collectively...as a bar, you don't want to offend them. On top of this, we knew the party promoters personally and many of the people involved in this particular event, and we had made this clear in the very beginning.\n\nNow for the reason for the dreaded one-star review...the manager.\n\nThe manager was visibly irritated that he had been summoned. His first words to us: \"Why should I let you into my bar for free?\" At this point he had been made aware that this was a birthday entourage, but aside from that his comment was loud and intentionally insulting. We are not rude people and were in the midst of an extraordinary night out, so our response was not rude at all. We simply said, \"Well, there are 12 of us, we're going to be buying many, many birthday shots and drinks, and we know many of the people hosting this event. Plus, we look great! We're in costume and even your door personnel, security, and people on the patio are clamoring for us to come in.\" His response: \"I can't just let you in for free, what is it that you even do?\" It was obvious at this point that this man was rigid, humorless, rude, and beyond salvaging our acceptance of just paying the cover and going in (which was never even ruled out). So, we started just laughing at how offensive this man was being to us while he attempted to suggest we take our party elsewhere. He even went to the lengths of following us out and down the stairs of the public walkway, as if to insinuate that we had acted inappropriately and were being escorted.\n\nGypsy bar - if you read this, I hope it registers that someone felt treated so badly by your staff that they were compelled to take the time to write out a review on this site. I hope it also registers that your bar earned ONE out of FIVE stars on this site without the person writing it even having to set foot in the door. I would highly recommend this establishment to those who enjoy being insulted repeatedly and treated like a third-rate citizen. For those looking for friendly staff and a welcoming vibe, downtown Phoenix has a lot of options.", "type": "review", "business_id": "83da7v9gQsWJegTW52qnuw"}

I've been here a few times- the most recent time was to get stuff for my last minute Halloween costume. And they had it RIGGED up. They had these rather intimidating men in security vests (who were actually very nice) directing traffic flow into their lot. I got there at the right time- swung up, waited maybe 30 seconds for somebody to back out before pulling up and parking.\n\nThere is actually two parts to the store. On the west side is the costume rental side, and on the east side is the actual store itself, where you can purchase almost anything you want, if it's related to costumes, fancy dress and whatnot. \n\nService at this place is consistently pretty excellent. I've been during peak and off peak. During peak nobody bugs you if you don't want help, but they are more than willing to help you if you do. I was able to get in, get a white foundation, black eye cream, a powder and green spray on hair dye very quickly, with the girl's help. \n\nI went once ages ago as well, during off peak for extras as part of a cosplay outfit for a convention. The same thing- it was a lot quieter, but they were helpful when I wanted them to be, left me alone otherwise. \n\nThis place really is a gem. They have beautiful wigs, all quite a nice quality, pretty inexpensively priced. Their range of makeup is astounding, and they've got all the knick knacks you might possibly need for any outfit. I'm sure if you had a particular idea but possibly weren't sure how to execute, all you had to do would be ask your salesperson and they'd direct you and give you ideas. \n\nSince I plan to cosplay for a con again next year, I'd imagine I'll be in to get a wig and other accoutrements. The interwebs is good and all, but there's something to be said for being able to go to a store and see, right there, what is available.

It's also reasonably new. Up until a couple of months ago my office was a quarter mile from this place. I'd passed the sign a couple of times and gave it a shot one evening. Prior to trying TT2, I'd been a regular at Maharaja's Palace (pretty much on the diagonally opposite [SW] corner of 57th Ave), and if you like you can read my review of the latter to see why I won't eat there anymore.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at TT2. It's a little more expensive but the food appears to be of higher quality. Basically the naan is the freshest/tastiest I've had in the US. Unfortunately they're light on beef dishes (probably because the moo cow is held in higher regard than people are back in India?) and I missed things like beef saag and vindaloo, but everything else is real good. They have \"chaat\" on the weekends - kinda like the Indian equivalent of Spanish tapas? - but there are several items on this particular menu that aren't available during the week and that's a bit strange.\n\nLunch specials are pretty good. There's a different main dish each day and they serve quite an acceptable portion of rice, that dish, salad and raita. Unfortunately most of the guys in my office are Phoenix-born and for some reason they consider Indian food to be anathema (I've literally gotten laughed at when I proposed this place once as a lunch destination) and thus I typically don't have too many lunch partners when I've eaten here. Then again these are the same guys who'll eat the most wretched Mexican slop I've ever gagged on in my life.. day after day, over and over and over.. but I digress..\n\nOne black mark against this place, they aren't open on Mondays. It's Monday today and I'd kill for some Indian for dinner so that totally sucks. Anywhere that isn't open 7 days a week really needs to reevaluate. Fortunately I can cook the stuff at home - that's when I have three hours to spare..\n\nSummary: It's far from the best Indian restaurant that I've eaten at, but it's the best in Phoenix that I've found (admittedly, I haven't tried anything on the east side YET.. *8-)", "type": "review", "business_id": "6VRbbNQe5ouWmwsMebUMkg"}

First: the folks who work there are totally non-judgmental. Doesn't matter how you dress or what you look like; they treat everyone who comes with respect and a positive attitude. That goes a long way with a working person like myself who doesn't try too hard to impress and often gets judged for not 'dressing the part' of success. When I travel it is often with juicers, boxes of veggies, a multitude of dogs or even collectibles. I really appreciate their fair treatment of each of us who stayed at this great location. Really super management model.\nThe place was beautiful to be in and at, clean and uplifting. The colors, textures, even the sunlight coming through the sheers and room dividers brought a smile to our faces. The grounds are well maintained, the people who work at the front desk, restaurants and even the maids are all polite and caring to each who need them. I couldn't ask for a nicer stay and will be sure to return only next time with a bunch of friends in tow to enjoy the suites. \nThanks so much for taking care of us!

I believe that Agritopia is one of the premiere developments in the state for everything you want in a neighborhood. As I write this, I hear birds chirping in the trees and can spot residents cycling through the streets, enjoying the meticulously landscaped neighborhood.\n\nWhen I first ventured out to Gilbert, nearly 4 years ago, I drove by Agritopia and immediately thought, \"This is a neighborhood from Desperate Housewives.\" Turns out, I was wrong. Dead wrong. I told myself that I could never live in a neighborhood that seemed like it was nothing more that a clean, pristine facade. However, nearly a year ago I moved into the neighborhood, and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Here's why:\n\nLocation: Direct access to the Loop 202 makes it easy to get anywhere in the Valley in about 30 minutes. Also nearby is San Tan Village Mall. The mall is growing and developing into a nice outdoor mall with mid-range to upscale shops.\n\nNeighborhood: The neighborhood is beautiful and very well planned out. There are many styles of houses with differing floor plans. There's a home that is the right size for anyone. My parents have a single story, with a basement that is perfect for entertaining; while my wife and I have a small, two-story cottage, that is the perfect starter home for us. Agritopia boasts the smallest two-way streets in the Valley, to help promote pedestrian walkways and reduce the heat island effect within the neighborhood. Given the narrow streets, all homes are equipped with emergency sprinkler systems, reducing homeowner's insurance. \nThere is also a nice community center that is optimal for hosting small events (my wife and I had a wedding shower there, and the community has neighborhood events throughout the year). Not to mention the fitness room with workout equipment, and a nice pool that is even heated in the winter months. \nThe beautiful homes have front doors that face each other and promote social activity in front of the homes with neighbors. This is the optimal way to get to know who lives near you and build lasting relationships, which promotes a true sense of community. \n\nAttractions: Keeping with the sense that this land was once a farm lives on for those in the neighborhood. There is a community garden where residents can have their own plot of land to plant, grow and harvest their own crops. (Also promoting sustainability!) There is also a commercial farm which supplies produce to the nearby Joe's Farm Grill and Liberty Market. Joe's Farm Grill is the popular restaurant built from the Johnston's old home. You may have seen them on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. This is a great lunch spot! Also, there is The Coffee Shop. Located in an old tractor covering, this coffee house has specialty espresso drinks and pastries. Jessica Cuff, owner, was on Cupcake Wars and took home 1st place for her delicious treats. The farm at Agritopia has a farm stand where the fresh, local, organic produce is available for purchase at extremely reasonable prices.\n\nKeep an eye out for this becoming THE PLACE to be in Arizona. Plans for an assisted living development are in the works to break ground this spring/summer. Also, the commercial corner (named the EpiCenter) is in planning stages. This will bring artisan products and establishments to the corner promoting local businesses, walkability, and gourmet food/drink.", "type": "review", "business_id": "IrICJMK0sIzgTH_FUImihA"}

As a guy who's eaten at a lot of fast food restaurants over the years, I can say this without question. I used to eat their scrumptious chicken nuggets at their old location at Metrocenter mall when I was little, and I have had a love for their food ever since. If you love chicken as much as I do, you will be hard-pressed to find a better recipe. They know how to prepare chicken better than anyone. The use of peanut oil to fry their chicken makes it healthier and much less greasy than their competitors. Throw in a fantastic mix of herbs and spices, incredible waffle fries, a wide variety of condiments, and homemade lemonade, and you have yourself the most fantastic meal you'll ever get at a fast food establishment. Whether you go for one of their sandwiches, the nuggets, or the breakfast items, the chicken is without equal. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DAIBZ-I6i5wEUsxEolzXBA"}

The atmosphere is very nice with good decor.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us right away.  Our waitress was helpful and attentive.  But the food was not good.  I ordered the tofu veggie sizzling platter and the menu said it was seasonal veggies.  I did ask for asparagus.  If I had not done that, I would have had carrot shreds, onions, green onions, some sort of bean, and that was it.  No other color or veggies.  Very drab and what little asparagus I got, they charged me an extra $2.  Very disappointing dish, with too much salt and heavy flavorings.  The tofu was steamed by itself and had no flavor as well.  usually tofu will take on the flavor of whatever it is cooked with.\nMy husband had the sweet and sour chicken which he found to be very boring and bland.  Our salads before the meal was a non event as well.  The cucumbers were in a state of being overdone and mushy, mixed in with ones that were too ripe.  The sauce was way too sweet and my husbands salad was not worth mentioning as well.\nWe will not return there.  If we want good Asian food we will go to Flo's next time.\nI will say the outside patio looked very attractive with cushions on the seats and neat flames for atmosphere.  \nWish the food was better, because the decor is well done and attractive.", "type": "review", "business_id": "UW32rmopWuDpT0X1b4RUXA"}

Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) \n\nWe ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.\n\nWe both had wine, the \"single glass\" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)\n\nNeither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!\n\nWe also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. \n\nI will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. \n\nThere are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.\n\nGood experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3GAPcBG8SowgrpS6UHlDeQ"}

We try different things; a lot of it palatable, most of it good and some of it great.  But when you enjoy a meal that is truly superb, in every sense of the word, it sticks with you.  \n\nSuperb describes our recent experience at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale.  Located inside the toney Saguaro Hotel (hipster haven and loved it!), Distrito is a lone outpost, holding down the fort in far flung Arizona, leagues from its' Garces Group cousins back east.  I was surprised to learn that Garces Group, which apparently has a stronghold in the Philadelphia and Atlantic City food scenes, has a few outliers here in the Southwest; Distrito & Old Town Whiskey at The Saguaro in Scottsdale and Tonto & El Jefe in the swanky Saguaro Hotel in Palm Springs.  Personally, I'm a big fan of indie & local, but I also think there's  a place for regional chainlets to show their colors.  Garces Croup's Distrito does just that.\n\nOur meal at Distrito was my freshman introduction to the Gacrces Group and man, it made a great first impression on me!  The menu is chock full of small plates and sharing options (as well as as full meals), so we took a snacky approach to dinner.  My other half and I wanted to sample a variety of items from the menu and agreed we'd get more bang for our buck by going micro, rather than limiting ourselves to just an app and a main course.  I'm glad we did!\n\nWe started off with the guacamole; a tell-tale bell weather of how the rest of the meal might go at any restaurant, and we were more than delighted with the fresh, hand-hacked guac, dusted with fresh cotija cheese and delicious chips.  We decided to splurge a bit and added the fresh crab (only $5!!!) and didn't regret it for one second. The crab was so fresh, I'd swear we were dining on the beach in the Chesapeake Bay (except we'd never get avocados that fresh in MD), so we were thrilled with the bi-coastal combo!\n\nMoving onto the \"Snacks\" or Antojitos section, we split an order of Rellenitos.  A clever twist on the classic \"Chile Relleno\", this bad boy was served sliced , each piece breaded and fried to perfection with the tastiest smoked tomato sofrito I've ever had the pleasure of spooning past my lips.  150% scrumptious!\n\nMy other half scarfed Pescado Tacos after the server told him the fish of the day (the species escapes me now) that constituted the fish tacos.  Divine!  We then each split Small Plates of Queso Fundido (with a savory Duck Barbacoa) and Chilpachole de Mariscos; a spicy seafood stew.  My boif loved the Queso (I'm not a huge fan of duck, but it was very tasty) and I laid quick waste to the bowl of Chilpachole,which was chock full of fresh mussels, clams and hand-made masa dumplings.  The stew sauce alone is incomparable and I've been craving a return visit since we ate there, even if just for this dish alone!\n\nRounding out the extraordinary (and I do not use that word lightly!  This meal was EXTRA-ordinary), I give big props to the staff and service of Distrito Scottsdale.  Our server was adorable, knowledgeable, friendly and quick as a flash with food, drink refills and answering questions for us.  The General Manager Niels even stopped by our table to chat with us, check on everything and make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  That is rare in this day and age and I appreciate the personalized attention, brief and non-intrusive conversation and approachability.  I told him we'd be back and I stay true to my promises.\n\nApparently Distrito has a revamped menu and is remodeling inside.  If there were one thing I would take points off for, it would and could only be the d\u00e9cor -- in that I was facing a blank wall during dinner. Considering that my attention was fully focused on the fantastic food, savory servings and the company of my adorable other half, I barely even noticed the walls!\n\nI'd like to go back to Distrito soon (even if just for that Chilpachole seasfood stew!!!) and pace myself so I could try their Platos Fuertes (Large Plates) and dessert menu. We never even made it that far because we were STUFFED on apps and small plates. For 2 big boys to not reach dessert phase, you know the portions are generous and the servings substantial.  \n\nI'd also like to get a group together some time and give their Taco Bar a try.  It's $25 per person (min 2 peeps) and features an assortment of tasty Latino fare that I'm sure would knock my socks off -- if it's anything like the meal we experienced 2 weeks ago at Distrito in Old Town Scottsdale inside The Saguaro Hotel.

I would definitely go to other events held here, but probably not unless there was something specific.", "type": "review", "business_id": "TP4ibW_dRx-jIJM_Ytz22w"}

Trillium could be a much better place to live, but it is not. When I first toured the complex, it was a Saturday afternoon - the college kids were either drunken from their hangovers or working on picking up the next skank at the local bars. If you REALLY want to see this place in its true color, then you need to tour it at night after hours.\n\nThe proximity is close to ASU. The idiots are loud and obnoxious. The walls and windows are just not insulated enough to keep out their yelling, loud cars, and motorcycles. The only salvation is if you live on the 3rd floor and get lucky enough to have quiet individuals next to you and below you.\n\nParking needs its own paragraph. You will not be able to find a place to park if you own more than one car. You will be assigned one parking place. I've had college kids try to park in my parking place also. Forget finding another place to park though. They invite all 50 of their friends over for the weekend. Parking is simply out of the question here. So if you take the bus or don't own a car, this is the perfect place for you.\n\nThe grounds are reasonably maintained. Lately they've been doing less with the landscape and there's dog ---- just about everywhere you walk. Lighting is ok - could be better as it seems very dim when walking through the corridor to your apartment at night.\n\nThe apartments themselves are fairly spacious, but beware the cheapness! Cheap fixtures everywhere. Plastic countertops, pressed wood cabinets, poor insulation, stained carpets, and shoddy piping.\n\nThe maintenance people are nice, but they do not know what they are doing. If it's easy, they can fix it with no problem. If it's more complicated, it requires several visits. My washer didn't drain the water during the drain cycle for nearly three months. I told them the washer needed to be replaced. They danced around the issue during this time until I wrote a very demanding letter that was extremely firm. All the while, I was spending more in utility costs because my clothes had to be dried for hours.\n\nThe staff have absolutely no clue what they are doing. I always place rent checks, two of them, in an envelope with the statement and then seal it and deliver it personally to the person at the front desk. They lost one check, but not the other. I took the issue all the way up to the corporate office when they threatened to terminate my lease and made it seem like we had been the ones at fault for their mishandling of checks. Their corporate office explained there were several people handling the checks during the long journey back to the corporate office to be cashed. It IS NOT the tenant's fault if checks are lost or stolen by the office personnel.\n\n**An update to the above paragraph - after fighting with the office about the check and writing them another check (never do this especially if you have a carbon copy) they agreed to at least pay the stop payment on the check -$35. The corporate office explained this would be an \"instant\" credit. So I went in during my next month's rent payment and the front office said it would be on my next bil. Not very instant but I waited patiently for the next month. The next month came, and still no credit. I finally had to call the corporate office again and complain. Not one thing was done to compensate me for wasting my time and causing problems. The office crew and the business team at Trillium are absolutely INCOMPETENT. \n\nLease agreements are the worst. They will charge you $1,660 to terminate your lease instantly PLUS the incentives you have received. For example, they \"say\" the apartment I live in is really $1,155 a month, but they are giving me a \"discount\" and I only pay $932 a month. If you terminate, you must pay the $1,660 fee plus the difference of the discounted rate and the regular rate for all of the time you've been there. That's some pretty shady business practices.\n\nYou would be a great fit for this place if you are under the age of 25, act immaturely, like to get loud and drunk, don't have a car or take the bus, don't mind the noise, don't care about cheap crap in your apartment, enjoy the hassle of the maintenance crews and incompetent office personnel, and just really generally don't care.\n\nMy advice: DO NOT waste your money here. These apartments are already expensive and you certainly do not get what you pay for.", "type": "review", "business_id": "2tL3VT4jy84MmwhxOA96Qw"}

For beer and spirts, for example, they just have the most common top selling items and very little of the rare stuff.  For single malt Scotch, you're lucky if there's just a handful of independent bottlings on the shelf.  Virtually everything is distillery bottlings.\n\nWith beer, there's none of the rare items like the Scandanavian beers, the special releases from Lost Abbey and others, and nobody knows about both of these two products.  There are a few employees who can chat to some extent but it's obvious they don't have the actual tasting experience to give you an informed opinion of their own selection.\n\nCheckout is notoriously slow and they go way overboard in asking for ID, even when you're multiple decades above 21 in age.", "type": "review", "business_id": "RCc01aDaUvQ-sWfoalfjXA"}

Well, the new breakfast menu is nothing like that. I had trouble finding something that I actually WANTED to eat. Instead of three-egg omelets for $6.95, they now have one and a half or two egg frittatas for $7.95-- so they raised the prices and you're now getting even less food for the money.

And we saw this place so decided to walk in. \n\nBefore even hitting the door, I noticed an older couple leaving. They saw us, Urban people, and stared a little longer than my comfort level normally allows. I rolled my eyes as we entered.\n\nFirst thing was a nice blast of cold air. I liked that. The atmosphere was exactly what you would expect of a bakery cafe. Dark stained wood. No ceiling. And some upbeat trumpet based jazz playing, the volume turned up higher than normal. \n\nThe line was slightly long, but fast moving. When you first come in, there is a paper menu on the table, and unless you have great vision, with a hint of magnification attributes, I suggest you grab one. \n\nApparently, all their food is homegrown. Which gave me hope for a more delicious meal. But of course, this also drives the prices a little higher. When we got to the cashier, I ordered the Anaheim Scrambler. Which is described as scrambled eggs with bacon, cheese, tomato, and topped with avocado pieces. I got a large pre-made/homemade lemonade. Overall $10.00\n\nTaric got his food first after we sat down, and it took him eating a whole half a sandwich before I got my food... My plate certainly looked impressive. A standard helping of eggs. I cup of assorted fresh looking fruit. And two half slices of their own wheat bread. The eggs were fantastic, in my opinion. They were cooked perfectly. And the bacon and cheese was delicious as well. However the best part was the avocado! It enhanced the meal perfectly. The fruit was fresh. The lemonade good. The bread was a little dry, which was disappointing considering this was a bakery, and I expected fresh bread.\n\nIn the end, I was satisfied. The price matched the quality. Next time, during the colder seasons, I want to try their coffee. And their black tea, which according to Taric is the best black tea of all time!?!?!?!", "type": "review", "business_id": "aBjWR-Mol58GMsRAdz2Tjw"}

It looks super classy inside and the deco on both floors is amazing. The best part? It is waaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than it looks. We had $5 martinis (perfectly made), $9 pizzas and $8-11 sandwiches.\n\nLet me explain. The pizzas CANNOT be eaten by 1 person (and trust me, I can eat, and I refuse to not finish my plate). So, you HAVE to share this pizza, which makes it $4.50 per person and you end up REALLY FULL after eating 1/2 of it. The margarita and the quattro (4 cheese) were absolutely amazing: thing crust, fresh ingredients and lots of flavor.\n\nWe also all split onion strings and a cauliflower appetizers, so between 4 people it only came down to $3 per person for both appetizers.\n\nComplete success. Will definitely return and try their desserts. What an awesome place. Too bad I had to spend it with a douche next to me, but I made my best effort to focus on the food and the other people there, and my experience was still 4 starts-worthy (and that says a lot, cause the dude was a biiiiiig douche).", "type": "review", "business_id": "6imLt53br7SJ3av07jjH7w"}

The first thing I noticed are the oysters - boom - right in front of you on display and labeled from location. After settling in, you start to get a 'San Francisco' type vibe in the atmosphere with the 40's music, white tiles, open kitchen, etc. (dare I say it - I know Bay Area natives will probably turn up their noses at that as they do for every thing else).\n\nYou absolutely cannot come here without getting the oysters, don't even think about it. Second, do you like crab? Well, they have a \"Warm jar of King Crab and butter with grilled bread\" - verbatim, that is what it says on the menu. I want to die eating a warm jar of king crab and butter, that is how good it was. Lastly, you have to get the frog legs. Don't be a wuss, sack up and eat them. They are delicious, super tender, and have an incredible Thai chili sauce. We ate everything family style, I recommend you do the same.\n\nTop all of it off with great service from our server Casey and you have a fantastic seafood dining experience in Phoenix.

We had a restaurant.com certificate for this place for quite some time so thought it was time to use it. We started with the Papa Rellena, which is a mashed potato ball stuffed with ground beef and raisins and deep fried. It came with a salsa on top with a side of a green dipping sauce. This was delicious and the potato was perfectly seasoned and light, didn't feel heavy at all. The green sauce was amazing, reminded me of a chimichurri sauce that you could put on anything!\n\nHubby got the Bistek a lo pobre, which was a grilled steak, served with white ricFrench fries and topped with fried bananas. Unfortunately, the steak was underwhelming and lacked seasoning and the rice was undercooked (it was pretty crunchy and inedible). Hubby did like the fries and the fried banana was good. \n\nI ordered the Arroz con pollo, which was a chicken thigh and drumstick served with cilantro fried rice. The good news was the cilantro fried rice which was very good and flavorful. The bad news was the chicken, it was obvious that the chicken was not cooked fresh. It seemed as though it was cooked earlier that day or even the day before and just heated up again and put on the plate. The skin was soggy and the meat didn't have as much flavor as I wanted it to have. Thank goodness for the green sauce cause that was the only way it made it worth eating.\n\nOur waiter, while nice, seemed scattered and spread too thin. There were not a lot of other tables and he seemed to only be serving ours and two others yet my hubby didn't get his drink refill and he didn't really check back with us after he brought our food. After we ordered our meal he came back and asked us if we wanted an appetizer and we mentioned that the papa rellena was our app, he seemed confused by that. At the end of our meal when the check came, he didn't deduct our restaurant.com certificate amount and our app wasn't listed. I'm not sure if he thought that by not charging us for the $8 app was going to offset our $25 off cert. It took a while for the staff to figure it out but it eventually came back correct. \n\nOverall, not sure if we will be back. While the app was good and the green sauce delicious, it doesn't seem worth making the 40min drive when neither of us were happy with our entrees. Too bad cause we had high hopes for this place.", "type": "review", "business_id": "EFJAVVBQQqftuqY5Wb3WtQ"}

The food is fine - like any other MacDonald's - but they have a tendency of getting orders wrong ... for me anyway and no, I do not ask for any kind of unreasonable custom order.\n\nI am putting my grievance here because the managers there just don't seem to care.  On several occasions this particular Micky D's has gotten my order wrong.  A nuisance at first but I was willing to let it go one time ... two times ... three times. \n\nAbout a month ago, I'd already lost track how many times they have gotten our order wrong.  I didn't have a receipt but I did call the manager because I wanted to let them know they should work on training employees about reviewing orders.  It has happened one too many times for me not to speak up.  She was apologetic and even tried to rectify the situation, \"Come by next time and I'll still let you get your order for free.  Tell them Corrinda said it was ok.\"  I was like, \"Whoa, that was awfully generous\" and thanked her.\n\nA couple of weeks later, I had to take my daughter to the ER for a scorpion bite.  This Micky D's is barely a block away so I sent the husband to get our dinner.  \"They forgot my McNuggets.\"  Well, this stressed out mamma with a screaming baby in the ER with the worst pain that anyone could possibly imagine was not going to take this sitting down.\n\nI drove back to the Micky D's with our order and receipt and asked to see the manager.  I told her about our most recent experience in addition to the missing McNuggets.  She was apologetic, saying her minimal, obligatory apology and sent me on my way.  She said something about just starting but that got me even more pissed off that she was defending getting orders wrong.  There's no excuse.  Don't even get me started on the fact that she hardly spoke English, which I believe may have contributed to her reticent behavior.  Come on now, at the managerial level, communication with customers is pretty vital I would think.\n\nI left flabbergasted that my money wasn't refunded - not even that it wasn't refunded but it wasn't even offered -  but I knew I had to take a breather because my daughter needed a mamma who was calm and collected.  No point in getting steaming mad.  \"You got your nuggets so just let it go!\" I told myself.  \n\nThe next day I decided to get our \"free breakfast\" because it was a hellish night before to get up early and make breakfast for everyone.  When I dropped Corrinda's name to the cashier and how she was going to comp my next order, she asked for a receipt, I said I didn't have one, and she was going to ask the manager what to do.  A minute later she came back and told me they couldn't give me the breakfast for free if there was no receipt.  I told her get the manager out here so I can explain.  She goes to the back again and comes back out a couple minutes later and says that the manager approved.  Again, I wonder if this is a training issue because i would have expected for this  manager to come out and talk to me.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nice and there is a playground.  The food is fine - tastes like MacDonald's.  I will be coming here as little as possible for the sole fact that my orders have been incorrect on so many occasions that I've lost count.  The manager's don't seem to have a good handle on training their employees and the managers themselves don't seem to know how to handle customer issues.", "type": "review", "business_id": "QTBUIAFtdUx-YMcWaI3GiQ"}

It was just a few blocks up so we heel-toe expressed it over to our destination, enjoying the pre-nightclub streets of the Dale and a spectacular show of color from the Arizona sunset. The sky oozed romance with reds and yellows flowing overhead guiding us to what was building to be a nice romantic evening out.\n\nMedizona is located inbetween Old Town and Fashion Square Mall on the East side of Scottsdale Road. It is slightly buried in an older office area and the building itself seems to be a pastiche of what used to be multiple office suites repurposed for the culinary experience. The setting is subdued with low lighting and minimal decoration. There is a large room to the right that seems to be more for nightclub action, though we were there too early to see any such action.\n\nWe were waited on by a very comforting and professional gentleman who had the air of being the owner or manager. We choose a couple of glasses of Shiraz from Annies Barn and it was suggested we go with the sampler starter which consisted of a Rabbit Fig Baklava, Lamb in and Eggplant Taco, and Grilled Shrimp with Risotto. The Lamb and the Shrimp were tasty though not quite spectacular. I have a feeling that sampling them all together diluted the experience. I would recommend going 2 times and trying them seperatly. I say 2 times because the Rabbit Fig Baklava is not worth its own trip. The sweetness of the Fig here is out of place and conjours the flavor of a Grape Tootsie Roll Pop, which is not a good flavor for a rabbit dish.\n\nFor the entrees I chose the Lamb as I am always curious to see another take on a classic dish and my girlfriend went with the Salmon which we were told was going to be a featured dish in the upcoming issue of Gourmet Magazine. Both dishes were very good and I would recommend either to anyone anytime.\n\nMy overall take on Medizona is that its a very nice restaurant with a different take on things - crossing Mediteranian with Southwestern dishes - and I would recommend it for both romantic and small group dinners. The themes create a unique and memoriable experience without being too overdone or cliche.", "type": "review", "business_id": "81a6sTDzNzsRsoUETeoBRA"}

The Groupon described this place as an upscale Mexican restaurant.  We sat down to an assorted chips variety of banana chips, blue corn tortilla, and regular tortilla chips.  There were 4 different salsas to go with it.  I was impressed with the banana chips thrown into the basket.\n\nWe ordered chicken enchiladas, vegetarian cheese enchiladas, and grilled fish tacos with rice and beans.  The enchiladas were quite a big portion, but they had unique flavors that I could not figure out.  My dish was the fish taco and it was the best fish taco I have ever had!  It was lightly seasoned with chipotle sauce and lime vinagrette.  It was the perfect size for 1 person.  I think some of their other portions like the enchiladas can be shared, or you will have take home food.\n\nThe ambiance was very modern and lively.  The service was great.  My only negative that may give this a 4-star instead of 5-star is that the menu is somewhat limited.  I am not a big fan of pork, and many of the dishes I would have ordered would have had something like scallops and pork belly.

The areas are clearly marked, well organized, easy to shop, and have a decent amount of variety in each section. There's lots of parking outside, and if the registers are well-staffed, you've got plenty of checkout options.\n\nWhat I don't like:\nThrifting is really hit or miss, but it was all miss. It looks like it's pretty picked over, so I was left with a dog from every town. While the clothing section was okay, the other sections aren't quite as well organized. Sure, it's tough to organize things when they're all one-of-a-kind, but it was a touch cluttered. I don't worry too much about that--this is thrift store shopping, after all--but it only takes a few extra minutes to tidy it up.\n\nWhat I'm indifferent about:\nPricing. They do have that color-coded discount thing going on, so you can save some bucks depending on the week. That's kinda cool. But on the daily, it's pretty much what you'd expect to pay. Cheap, which I love. But not any cheaper than other thrift stores. Also, they have a little bit of everything, but nothing that got me wowed.

I went for the burrata--which I could have just sustained myself on that. The house-made soft cheese was the perfect texture and not too salty. The scoop they give is plenty split between 3-4 people with the accompanying crostinis. I tried two different pizzas: one with mushroom and Schreiner's sausage, the other was \"The Casanova\" _ prosciutto, dates, ricotta and arugula. I never thought of dates on pizza but I'm a believer. The dates' sweetness combined with the prosciutto is almost heaven-sent. I liked that much better and would fight off anyone who tried to take my share. I know it may be kind of sucky that their pizzas are only available in one size. But hey, that means you get leftovers of some really fantastic pizza.\n\nThe vibe is definitely a cross of hipster and white-collar work crowd.

The resort itself is absolutely stunning!! The grounds are very well kept and the staff is very friendly and helpful.\n\nThe wedding was held on the golf course and made for an amazing view of the mountains and sunset (which was perfect for this 530 wedding). The area where the reception took place was right below the main restaurant/bar for the resort. the area provided was small but perfect for the amount of people attending (they may have a separate location for bigger parties) there was plenty of room on the dance floor for us to all get-down and boogie! \n\nThe resort also catered the food and I must say I was very impressed. AS the guests of the party entered the reception area we were greeted with smiles by two young ladies serving finger foods as appetizers. There was a try of baby bruschetta, and crape wrapped asparagus sprinkled with asiago cheese. Both were very good but I must say to the restaurant manager... if this asparagus isn't on your normal menu it should be and ASAP! They were Delicious and everyone really enjoyed them!! For dinner we had the option of a steak which came with a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus or salmon that came with a side of rice pilaf and asparagus. I was lucky enough to try both options and personally i would always pick salmon of steak but this time around I enjoyed the steak much more! My steak was cooked just perfectly but i did hear other guests say there's was a little rare for their liking (I didn't mind it at all). \n\nalthough I didn't have took much connection with much of the staff the ones that were working this party we all extremely nice and helpful! \n\nall in all i would defiantly recommend this location to throw and large corporate event or wedding.

I'm talking working there for at least the 15-20 years that we've been going to this place.  That is kind of impressive, you know.\n\nSo, what to order?  Well, if your idea of a Sunday afternoon (when we usually go) is to have a nice lunch and then have a functional, productive afternoon... don't eat here!  It doesn't really matter what you order.  99% of the time what you will be served is an elliptical plate with a 24\" major diameter that is chock full of greasyass refried beans, brown (aka Mexican) rice, and some other main dish that is covered in creamy salsa, cheese, or both!  \n\nI'm not saying it's bad (yes, it's bad for you) tasting, because it is actually quite tasty.. but, you 100% of the time regret ordering these dishes because of how you feel afterwards.  You're just bound to feel like a pig... heck, just wear your stretchy pants and one of those puffy blouses (gals, they are in style now) that way you can hide the bulge that will be your bloated belly.  Sigh... this is why I just get the fajitas these days...\n\nThe staff is mostly Spanish speaking (fine with me) and so are the patrons of the restaurant.

They should have told me when I ordered that it was only sausage and cheese and if I wanted anything added to it. My wife's sandwich came without any condiment either and she had to go to the counter and ask for mayonnaise.

Clearly a scheme. \n\nThe most disturbing part about the visit was when my dog wouldn't eat the dog biscuit the vet tried to give her.

She said \"Well, dogs eat anything, they even eat out of the trash.\"  and \"It's real cheese.\" wow. Her only valid justification was \"dogs need positive reinforcement after a visit\" which I completely agree with. BUT, you couldn't find a more suitable option for a treat? \n\nAfter speaking with the manager of the store, Brenda, I was told that they use Cheese Whiz as a distraction and treat for dogs because they like it so much. Well, yeah, I'm sure they would like a Whopper and fries too, but clearly that wouldn't be the best option for them. When I asked her if she would recommend Cheese Whiz as a healthy treat for dogs, she said, \"Well, no, but a little bit doesn't hurt.\" \n\nI highly doubt any veterinarian elsewhere would recommend Cheese Whiz as a suitable treat for dogs. \n\nNeedless to say, I am not giving Banfield any more of my service.", "type": "review", "business_id": "8z6So-uKgZf4a4LOf3pPKg"}

(:-\\) no bueno!\n\n\n\nPadre's you want to play yourself off as semi upscale mexican restaurant charging 15$ for 3 small tacos. service and atmosphere isn't deserving of your priceing. at least put my PBR in a glass instead of serving it to me in a can.\n\n\nin conclusion, i will give Padres another shot. but i am in no hurry to return.", "type": "review", "business_id": "6nseTZb6WrGWcithRThfag"}

They have an open kitchen area which can be fun if you like to watch the food being prepared, however I found it odd that while I saw food being prepared I didn't smell anything. I am used to walking by a restaurant and being tempted to enter because of the delicious smell of the food they being prepared there. I went to the counter and ordered the orange chicken they seem to be famous for. The total was $6.82 which seemed reasonable. I sat down and was quickly served in a matter of a few short minutes.  My dish was served on an oval shaped platter. The orange chicken was on one side and the other side was a large helping of white rice. The dish had large pieces of chicken sitting in a large pool of orange sauce. The orange sauce had many pieces of red pepper flakes and other spices I couldn't identify. There were five or six large red and black peppers to add some spice to the dish. The chicken was not over breaded like you might expect from places like Panda Express, but the sauce was overly sweet. The sauce seemed to have a thicker consistency to it like a syrup. The five or six large peppers were a welcomed relief from the sweetness of the dish but they ran out fast. The spices and pepper flakes in the sauce didn't translate into flavor on my tongue. Im usually a big fan of orange chicken but was very disappointed in it overall and would not order it again. The owner was there and seemed very friendly, thanking every customer as they left. I saw some other food being prepared as I left and I can tell they were making an honest effort to make good food here. I saw that they were roasting their own peanuts, for example, instead if just opening a package of ingredients and tossing it in the mix. Unfortunately, my experience today didn't equate to the dining experience I had hoped for. It was just way too sweet and lacking flavor.", "type": "review", "business_id": "sNuyncpQdcvfEpfZS-3Yew"}

Well worth the wait to enjoy al fresco dining on a beautiful patio. I thought the menu items overall were a tad pricey. So I decided to order the Hummus ($6) as an appetizer and the Italian Flatbread ($12) as an entree.\n\nThe Hummus had tomatoes, onions and I believe cucumber (it was really dark outside so I'm not sure about the cucumber) on top of the Hummus. An excellent combination of flavors. The best Hummus I have ever had. The Italian Sausage and Goat Cheese Flatbread was serviceable but I can't see myself ever ordering that again. The Sausage had a little kick to it but really didn't taste too great.\n\nI'm a little fuzzy as to whether the bread that the server asked if we wanted was free. Why would you ask a diner if you wanted free bread? So that kind of rubbed me the wrong way since it seemed like some covert upselling to me.

We arrived late on a Sunday morning, well after the crowd came through. When I sit down at any restaurant, I expect the wait staff to acknowledge me within a reasonable time. It took the waitress five minutes to even stop at the table, all the while checking in on the surrounding tables. Also, any time I visit a restaurant for the first time, I tell this to the staff, and ask for their recommendations on the menu. The waitress ignored these cues, and only asked what we wanted to eat.\n\nAfter the long wait for drinks to come, one of my dining friends realized that her glass was cracked. I'm not talking chipped at the rim, but a crack all the way down the glass. When we finally get the waitress to alert her of the situation, all she says is \"oh,\" picks up the glass, and walks away. Not even an apology for filling up a cracked glass in the first place.\n\nI ordered the kalua pork and hash for my meal. Let me be upfront, that my standards for kalua pork are imu style. I understand though, that in metropolitan Phoenix, this isn't possible. The kalua pork here was just not good. If L&L can do a decent kalua with liquid smoke, I'd rather go there.

A crepe egg is whipped egg whites with a crepe. Despite all the ingredients in the crepe it lacked flavor, it was literally bland, no seasoning at all. No amount or variety of hot sauce that was available on the table could salvage it. In addition, the crepe was this boring beige color which was fitting because the dish was boring as beige.\n\nMy friend ordered the \"BLT Supreme\" which normally comes on a 12 grain whole wheat toast with 6 slices of sugar cured bacon, lettuce, tomato, sliced avocado & mayo. However, she requested it to be on white toast instead. It came out with a side of seasoned potatoes. The bread came out burnt and too dry. The mayo was barely visible...it was pretty much inedible sandwich. Instead of returning the plate back to the kitchen, my friend just ate the BLT without the bread.\n\nMy other friend ordered the \"Eye Opener Combo\" which came with pancakes, 2 eggs and a few slices of bacon. It wasn't anything spectacular as that can be ordered just about anywhere.\n\nTo sum it all up, healthy food doesn't mean it should lack flavor, but that is exactly how this place was.

You need look no further than Quiessence, \"A Garden to Table Experience.\" As the BF pointed out, \"This is what Binkley's should aspire to be.\"\n\nThe philosophy of the restaurant centers around local and seasonal ingredients. Quiessence is a showcase for local growers such as McClendon's. The provenance of nearly every ingredient is noted with strong connections to Arizona. Chef Greg LaPrad's food is not only local, seasonal, sustainable and responsible, it's also delicious.  This is the kind of place that does Alice Waters proud.\n\nSince Quiessence depends upon the best seasonal ingredients, the menu changes nightly. The BF and I had the six-course tasting menu. The portion sizes were perfect and the wine pairings were good.\n\nAmuse Bouche:  As it should be, we were given a bite of apricot stuffed with local cheese and kissed by mint that left us wanting more.\n\nCourse 1: \"The Chef's Spread,\" a tasting of housemade salumi, terrines and cheese. It's nice to know the Quiessence Charcuterie and Salumi program grew out of the desire to use every bit of the animals purchased for the restaurant. The accompanying housemade carrot, zucchini and yellow squash pickles were delightful.\n\nCourse 2: Chilled salad of cantaloupe, Armenian Cucumber, tomato and housemade croutons in a yogurt and dill dressing. It's rare that I call a salad course fabulous. The BF and I are going to shamelessly steal the idea and replicate it for our next dinner party.\n\nCourse 3: Housemade gnocchi with pork ragut. My family on both sides traces its roots back to Italy, so I am picky with Italian food. Sous chef Anthony Andiario's handmade cheese-infused gnocchi were spectacular and the ragout was perfect. The bowl had been properly warmed to keep the dish at temperature while I luxuriated in it. Our server initially forgot to bring us the wine for this course, but it arrived about halfway through.\n \nCourse 4: Fried soft shell crab with zucchini. Neither the BF nor I like soft shell crab. However, this version was so perfectly prepared that we both savored every bite. The zucchini in a savory sauce was a perfect contrast to the seafood.\n\nCourse 5: Pork tenderloin with bean and mustard \"gruel.\" The pork was tasty and tender, but it was served fully pink in the center. We were fine with this, but some diners may not be as open-minded to rare pork. I liked the side dish, but the BF did not because it contained beans. The \"gruel\" was mondo ugly on the plate. Speaking of the plate, the tasting version came on a really awkward piece of china that curved up on one side to form a well for the gruel and then back down on the other side to create a small area for the pork slices. The plate felt crowded.\n\nUp to this point, dinner was utterly sublime and Quiessence was on its way to a perfect five star rating.  But then, alas, a star was lost with dessert.\n\nCourse 6: Sampling of cheesecake, pink grapefruit sorbet and chocolate \"torte\" with peach ice cream. These were classic \"chef's desserts;\" a cook made them but not someone with pastry skills. Chef Greg, please get yourself a pastry chef. With the access that your restaurant has to the freshest ingredients, your desserts should be a revelation. The best item was the pink grapefruit sorbet. It was tangy and refreshing and would have made a great intermezzo. The citrus zest cheesecake was okay, but a bit dense. The peach ice cream was fine. The chocolate \"torte,\" however, was an abomination. The BF theorizes the cake fell as it was grainy and lumpy. At first, I thought it was either supposed to be cheesecake or some sort of chocolate bread pudding. I confirmed with the server it was a \"torte.\" I cannot believe the kitchen allowed that mess to be served and it went back virtually untouched. The sad part is that was our final impression of the restaurant. Dessert cannot be an afterthought or lazy. The wine for this course was tawny and it did not complement the citrus flavors.  \n\nPutting the huge disappointment of dessert course aside, Quiessence was wonderful. We'll be back as this place would be a perfect showcase for guests or a special occasion. Next time we'll try the Brick Oven Table. It's a magical table outside in its own little cabana wrapped with mini white lights. It features an improvisational $95 pp eight-course meal that the chef and sous chef prepare for two to six people.\n\nQuiessence features a relaxed atmosphere. The interior is neutral and many of the decorative items appear to be from Marshall's. The environment is pleasant enough and does not distract from the food, which is the real star of the show.\n\nYour AMEX had best be prepared for a workout. The tab for the BF and I came to just over $310 with tax and tip. That included the $75 pp six-course tasting menu and the $40 pp wine pairings.\n\nPlease note that Quiessence is closed for the month of July.", "type": "review", "business_id": "-yxfBYGB6SEqszmxJxd97A"}

It is Korea's national dish, with a main vegetable ingredient such as napa cabbage.\n\nFrankly I was doubtful the Kimchee would be as good as I have got at some Korean restaurants, especially coming from a market.

We've never walked away hungry (and my husband could be a champion eater!!)  I guess the only caveat is we never have a to-go box of the delicious food to take home ; )\n\nAlso, if you like wine the owner has other bottles that aren't on his list and he prices them well...just need to ask!\n\nLatitude Eight is a gem in Downtown Chandler!!", "type": "review", "business_id": "mPGgxatANSPw9KbMluhXkA"}

This place was below mediocre first of all it had a very distinct smell in the whole restaurant and it was not a very appetizing one that's for sure. Secondly the server only came by twice once to get our order and the second time to bring out the food, she never bothered checking up on us or anything we actually had to flag someone else down just to get a refill. The food was ok I ordered two blueberry pancakes with an egg and bacon as well as a half order of the biscuits and gravy. The pancakes tasted as if they used a Bisquick mix and tossed in some unripe blueberries which was very disappointing because I usually LOVE pancakes out. The biscuits and gravy on the other hand were much better but still not good enough to bring me back . John had the country fried steak and gravy served with hashbrowns and eggs. He said the country fried steak itself wasn't bad but not his favorite, the hashbrowns despite having them topped with cheese, onions, peppers and jalapenos were very bland and needed a good dash of salt.

I have enjoyed Cafe Boa in the past, but it has been years. \n\nSo far we are off to a good start. The restaurant is decorated in soothing colors, clean and relaxing.\n\nThe server is very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. Wild Salmon with Basmati Rice and saut\u00e9ed veggies sounds great. Thanks!\n\nUh oooh! The tea is weak on tea on heavy on hibiscus or jasmine or dandelion, whatever they flavor it with. Oh, and did I mention it's empty...... and they aren't terribly busy and I'm sitting at the bar. \n\nTick-tock, Tick-tock...for as long as this is taking I'm concerned that my Salmon will be over cooked. It's not that busy people.\n\nTick-tock, Tick-tock...the wait staff must sense it, because they are leaning half way through the kitchen window looking for food. I guess this is why they have a decent beer and wine selection, gotta keep you happy during the wait. Too bad I'm only drinking iced tea. \n\nTick-tock, Tick-tock...as I sit and watch larger tables that came in after me being served their food. It's Salmon not rocket science.\n\nThe Salmon is a beautiful piece of fish and nearly perfectly cooked. The fish is great but I'm confused on where the chef was going with this dish. It has a \"corn relish\" on top that is really just corn. It all sits on top of a bed of rice and veggies. The veggies are nicely cooked but they have a Asian flavor that doesn't match the rest of the dish. \n\nWell, I was going to rate it a 3 star until I got my bill and saw they charged me $19.95 for that dish. Definitely not worth it.\n\nHi all,\n\nThe owners response to my original review is below. I did reply back to him directly, but I don't think it will be shown to all so I am adding my response here.Enjoy the reading.\n\n\n\nDear Scott,\n\nReally Scott?  \"Tea was full at all times, never empty as you stated\" You want to call me a liar? Not a good plan for salvaging relationships with potential customers. Trust me when I say it was empty....I know. \n\n\"we understand that you were by yourself\" This means there is only one dish to focus on, it's easy.\n\n\"the ticket time on the Grilled Salmon was not unreasonable\" If this is the case then why was the waiter appologizing for it and why were other tables of 3 people receiving their food before me? If the ticket time was appropriate in your judgement then it is likely that either the server failed to submit the order in  a timely manner or you have a IT/ticketing system issue. \n\n\"Your dish, as you stated, was perfectly cooked\" Yes the salmon was perfectly cooked and it was a georgeous pice of fish, but beyond the Salmon there was little flavor and what flavors there were, they did not blend together to make a satisfying dish. It was for this reason that the price was unreasonable. It was not a good dish.\n\n\"Perfect service and not even a 15% gratuity, really?\" Ohhh, I'm sorry you must have missed the part about the empty iced tea, long wait, other more complex orders for a larger group of people coming out before mine, a main dish that the flavors didn't blend well and ice tea that I didn't like. I am a tipper that over gives and you have to work hard to get less than 20%. That tip was an earned tip plus a generous donation considering the experience.\n\nYour response has helped solidify my 2 star rating of Cafe Boa.\n \nGary S.\n\nHi all,\n\nOne last update from me. I thought you might be interested in seeing the private note that the owner of Cafe Boa sent to me as a response to my last posting.\n\nCheers, \n\nGary S.\n\nFrom: Scott R. Owner\nTo: Gary S. \n\n\"I apologize for my following tone, but your response warrants the following:\nMy response isnt to make you change your rating, it really doesnt matter to me,  most normal people know when some reviews are legit and reasonable and some are just ridiculous and silly. We have thrived for 16+ years, no thanks to people like you. The fact of the matter is that your experience was Flawless, we serviced you with perfection,.. you were just looking to trash our establishment. Most of your comments above arent worth responding to, they are so silly.  We served you in a timely manner, albeit not as fast as you wanted, a high quality meal with friendly service and in return you sit there at our Bar during your entire meal, typing on Yelp any flaw you could find, wow, kinda sad, really. If you are a food critic, ok then I would understand, otherwise, get a life.\nWe will be here for another 16+ years, you can count on that.\"\n Hi all,\n\nDear Scott R.,\n\nUsing my full name in your public reponse is yet more proof of your poor ethical standards. So all reading please be aware that if Scott R. doesn't take well to your critical feedback that he will take your name from your credit card receipt and try to smear you online.

We were the first customers there.  We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip to begin with that was very good along with a martini. My husband ordered the rib eye steak and was informed it was marinated in some kind of a soy sauce and pineapple mixture.  In a reasonable amount of time our food was delivered to our table with a baked potato.  It was lacking butter but had a tbsp. of sour cream, chives and bacon bits.  It was definitely not warm (actually cold) but my husband and I ate it anyways.  Each entree comes with one side that is shown in the menu.  It is basically a la carte, no salad, soup or  bread which I have no problem with when the main entree is good!.  Next came the rib eye which my husband said did not taste good at all.  He did not care for the marinade but said even without it, the qualify of the steak was lacking.  He sent it back and ordered prime rib.  I had also ordered the prime rib and it was small, somewhat chewy and lacking in flavor.  When my prime rib was brought out by a girl that was not our waiter, she said oh, did you want horseradish?  I asked if it was creamed or raw to which she answered I do not know.  I asked her to bring out the horseradish and a side of sour cream in case it was very hot.  The so called horseradish had no horseradish in it and no flavor at all.   This was a first!   I ate about a 1/4 of it and decided that was enough.  My husband's prime rib was brought out about 20 minutes later,  a larger cut than mine although they just have one size, and it was very red and extremely rare.   He was never asked how he wanted his prime rib.  He was informed then that he could have ordered the rib eye without the marinade but this was never offered to him by the waiter or mentioned in the menu as an option.  He said it was just okay but was disappointed again.   I must say the waiter never returned to our table once my husband returned his food.  He avoided eye contact with us and did not return to ask how the food was, if it tasted good or if we needed anything else at that time.  At the end,  he asked if we wanted dessert and brought us the bill.

Croissants are one of those things I find tricky.  Most of them are terrible in these parts.  I went to the bakery next to Federal Pizza owned by the Coes hoping to find a good one.  The young man behind the counter told me that he believed the shop made them, but he had only been working there for 2 weeks and hadn't seen any made in that time.  I got on Yelp and since I didn't want to go out to Tempe to that apparently fabulous Essence Bakery, I decided to go to French Grocery.  I used to live around the corner from this place back in the day when it was a Circle K. (hey, that rhymed!)  I used to scrape together $1.50 in quarters and walk there to pick up smokes.  Yes, back in the 80s, cigarettes cost $1.50.....really.  But I digress.....I went into French Grocery and it seemed pretty bare bones.  The cheese case was tiny.  Like, you can get a better selection in the Safeway Deli... Many of them weren't even French.  But I was there for croissants.  I was going to a friend's house for coffee and thought these would make a nice accompaniment to the brew.  Wow.  What a complete disappointment.  I got 2 plain and two almond.  The almond ones were hollow where they should have had almond paste,  like the filling had melted out of them while baking.  We were left with the merest hint of flavor.  But the worst part?  The croissant dough was just bad.  Really bad.  I've lived in 2 cities with large Vietnamese populations and they are known for their excellent bakeries.  They were, after all, colonized by the French for a long time.  Anyway, I know my way around a great croissant and we didn't finish either kind.  The plain were just wrong.  Crusty like a biscuit, not flaky and buttery......dense and very dry.  It's almost as if they forgot to put the butter in the dough!  The consistency was so unlike that of a real croissant, they should take the French out of the name French Grocery.  Quelle disappointment.  I guess I'll have to continue my quest.  Also, they were way overpriced, even for a great croissant....Boo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "XFm8pUV58qOB7HbIGFLIrw"}

A friend of ours reserved a room for a promotion party, and we came here in anticipation of tasty pizza.  The party started with some crisp salad with a bottle of vinaigrette and garlic bread. Then, came the parade of pizzas.  The whole entire table was filled with various types of pizza to satisfy even the pickiest eater.  The pizza had a very thin crust, layered with various fresh ingredients such as ricotta, mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  The pizza sauce was robust and more paste-like (To prevent the pizza from getting soggy I'd imagine).  My favorite of the plethora of pizzas I tried was a lovely ricotta mushroom pizza with fresh mozzarella.  The only slight negative was that it was very easy for the pizza to get cold since the pizzas were so thin, which thus turned the cheese a little rubbery as it got cold. \n\nService was excellent despite having a large number of people to serve.  Drinks were refilled fairly promptly, and pizzas were served promptly after everyone had arrived.\n\nSince the pizza is thin, you can eat a ton of it before getting full.  I probably had twice the amount of pizza I normally would eat, both because of the tastiness of it and because of the actual pizza itself.  \n\nSo, if you're in the area and craving pizza, Grimaldi's is an excellent choice!", "type": "review", "business_id": "PjBeWzCOCveiPuF-xqUaoQ"}

Really glad we did- our meal was incredible. It's not a big place, but it has a fun atmosphere, decent sized bar, and lots of patio seating, which is nice starting this time of year. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and received excellent service throughout the meal. Not a huge beer menu, but definitely a solid selection and good happy hour prices ($4/pint, $10/pitcher). \n\nA smaller menu with excellent choices makes me happy and that's what they offer. We started off with the prosciutto wrapped asparagus- really glad we did that. Grilled just right and drizzled with a sauce that is slightly sweet made it even better. \n\nI got the burger, my husband got the brisket sandwich and we traded halves. Both were very tasty. The actual burger itself was full flavor- my only suggestion was maybe a few less toppings. I like a burger topped with a few things, but this patty had so much flavor that I felt all the toppings almost took away from it. \n\nThe brisket sandwich was the big hit of the night. Great flavor in the meat, tender and juicy and enough slaw on top to give it a a nice tang and add texture. The buns on both sandwiches were excellent and high quality. \n\nWe had our little one with us and they have a pretty good kids menu, too. It's not listed on the actual menu- the server will rattle it off for you. Ours is a grilled cheese fiend and theirs was great- two kinds of cheese on 9 grain, served with grilled asparagus and fries. We actually asked them to substitute tomatoes for the fries, which they easily accommodated, and she plowed through the hole thing. Minus the asparagus- but that's on her, not Grassroots :)", "type": "review", "business_id": "3wLLf8wRqD1ZQowi9aZSoA"}

Don't enter from the street, because the woman behind the bar did not nicely tell me to see the hostess on the other side. Don't put yourself through that--just enter from the parking lot/patio side.\n\nHaving said that, the patio was gorgeous. There's a nice fire pit, lots of little seating areas, and gorgeous old trees and vines.\n\nThe service, on the other hand, was pretty terrible. The sweet, young hostess tried her best to get us served, but it was futile. We sat at a dirty table for 10 min. or so. Then sat another 15 before she got a waitress for us. Our meals came out in a timely manner, but we had to ask for more water, ask for the the wine menu, etc. We got so tired of waiting we decided against another round and dessert. What surprised me the most was that there seemed to be no one experienced supervising a really young staff. No one (like a manager or owner) came through to check on tables or apologize for the wait at the table and lack of service.\n\nThe food was a bit better. My girlfriend had the BLT and chips. The sandwich was large and a bit charred but she said it was great. I had the bruschetta. I highly recommend the spicy copa and pesto, which was excellent. I'd pass on the brie, apple and figs, as the figs were terribly bitter and the over-sauced bread quickly became soggy.\n\nThe wine and beer lists were reasonably priced for by the glass or bottle.\n\nWe're hoping they improve on service for our next visit.

This spot has a few thinga going for it IMHO.  One, they just remodeled and it's beautiful, but I'm going to miss the old portraits of movie stars they used to have hung up for art.  They had Albert Einstein with his incredible shock of hair, a personal favorite hero,  a young Ella Fitzgerald, Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn(Breakfast at Tiffany's).  These photographs really jazzed up the place, but the wallpaper, rugs and other furnishing need updated, so I guess the remodel was good.

I order the Jumbo Jack which hasn't changed since I ordered it back in 1985.  They did raise the price from a dollar(Bah humbug!  Now, I just order a 99\u00a2 hamburger for value.

They almost never mess up my order as they are careful to repeat the order if they don't understand me.  They are fast too.  My only request would be to find a way to clean up the  garbage can and grease bin out back.

I'm primarily a fan of the veggie hummus sandwich, the silver haze, but the white widow, with chicken, bacon and ranch dressing, is also quite good, though somewhat heavier.\n\nA few years ago this location was quite a bit smaller but the owners bought the store location next door, kicked out the wall, and created a much bigger eating space, as well as putting in a bar at the back which provides eaters, stoned or not stoned, with a variety of delicious beers, several of them locally brewed.\n\nAt one time you ordered your sandwich and then waited for your name to be called and walked up to the happy hippy group where the sandwiches came out of the toaster oven, to choose your toppings and experience some cheerful hippy vibe. However, last time I went in, they killed the back end process, with everything being ordered up front. I have to say, NOT a fan of that change, it makes Cheba seem overly corporate and chain like and misses exposing customers to that classic hippy culture with that back end discussion with the sandwich makers so owners of Cheba Hut, if you are listening, stop trying to be so process driven, the inefficiency of the sandwich making, with the two step process, is a key part of your culture, it is what makes Cheba Hut, Cheba Hut, so bring it back!

I may not know everything about pizza, but I know what I like, and Grimaldi's gets a solid 5 for the crust alone. That crispy slightly smokey taste is unmatched by any other pie I've had. Interesting array of toppings, but I'd advise keeping it relatively simple: you don't want to bury the goodness of that thin crust, and the price adds up quickly with additional stuff. Salads are nice and large: splitting one between 4 people isn't a problem. \n\nWith 6 frequently used springform pans in my own kitchen, you might guess I have some strong opinions on dessert, and you'd be right: Grimaldi's cheesecakes are across the board far sweeter than I go for in my own baking, but that works for me with some of their more boutique flavors (I tried Oreo and Caramel-something-or-other last time, those were nice), but too sweet for something basic like NY style. In all fairness, you'd hear the same complaint from me pretty much anywhere that serves cheesecake. Slices are definitely generous enough to split between two.\n\nServers are young, energetic and attentive. The place is a tad more crowded and loud than I typically care for, particular during the snowbird season, which is about all that keeps Grimaldi's from an overall 5 rating from me.

Throughout the course, ponds, streams, waterfalls, and fountains make this a very unusual desert course.\n\nIt makes for very interesting golf, and if you have a tendency to stray off line, very difficult. There are three nine hole courses that depending on the day, are combined for 18 holes.  All are very playable if the correct tees are selected, and range from red - 5100 to gold - 6700.  \n\nThe course is in great condition, and managed by Troon Golf.  They do a very good job, and keep the course in very good to excellent condition.  There is a driving range, and above average practice facilities.  It might be noted that the course is surrounded by homes, but they are very out of the way, and a player doesn't have to worry about hitting into them.  Pace of play varies, depending of course on what kind of group you have in front of you.  Usually you can finish between four and five hours, and usually there is a marshall on the course.\n\nBernard's is also very nice, and is a great place to relax after 18 holes. They have a snack bar,  full bar, and full service restaurant, so you have a wide range of choices. The service is fast, friendly and efficient.\n\nThe only downside was that several of the persons working in the pro shop were not very outgoing - very business like, but not very social.  \n\nHowever, all in all, a great experience, and I will make this one of my favorite courses in the valley.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1zPhQ3_jdmQTn9_--IbYLQ"}

The guy said hold on and said \"Can we take orders for pick up? She is trying to avoid room service.\" Wow... just wow. This hotel is in a great location in the middle of the action in Tempe on Mill St. If I cannot order as a hotel guest for pick up then I would rather go pick up next door on Mill St where there are so many restaurants! Sheesh. Get a clue, dude. You have lots of competition being on Mill St and you are questioning whether I can order or not?  If the conference didn't give me a hotel credit I would DEFININTELY NOT be giving you my business because of that. How does he know I'm trying to avoid room service anyways... Wow. When I went to pick up there was not a single person in the restaurant! It was an odd hour though at around 1500. Again, wow...  I just had to get that off my chest... now onto the food.... \n FOOD: It's mostly bar type food but they also do have other more expensive entrees too. \n1. Kobe Burger with provolone on a pretzel bun ($11) - choice of cheese and choice of side. I picked the fruit bowl which included fresh pineapple, cantaloupe, honey dew. Burger patty was huge! The food was actually really good. I enjoyed it but I couldn't swallow the service. \nPRICES: Average.\nCONCLUSION: I will likely avoid this place if I can since I will be criticized for not getting room service. My room is right by the restaurant so of course I'm going to walk! The burger was good but wasn't that good to tolerate that kind of service. Obviously the only reason they got stars is because of the food. Luckily, the hotel does have 2 other restaurant called Cabana Bar and Grill by the pool and Mission Grille.

The staff is extremely friendly and clearly love dogs, which is one of the most important things I look for in a doggy daycare.  And they give great baths.  As far as boarding, I will not leave my dog overnight at any daycare that does not have someone who is on site overnight in the event something happens.  Fido's always has someone stay the night, which gives me the peace of mind that I need when I'm traveling.  They also are picky about dogs who can stay there, which means that they screen out the aggressive dogs.  The only negative about this place is that it doesn't have any outdoor play areas, but given the heat around here, that fact doesn't impact my review and certainly won't keep me from going back.

We went there for lunch, and occasionally dinner.  The food was always great.  \n\nWithin a few years the food was... fine.  So we stopped going.  Every now and then we'd go to the bar - it was in the neighborhood and all.  And the dance floor could be fun, and if the DJ was ok that night, you could have a good time.  \n\nI hadn't been there in at least 6 years, but the other night I was back on that side of town and was in a crowd of folks who \"still wanted to do something\" but they weren't willing to really drive more than 5 minutes.  (They considered this totally reasonable by the way.  How in the world did I ever get out???)  So once folks started talking about where the nearest Denny's was, or how there was a NEW Village Inn they could try - I volunteered Lagerfields.  It took a few minutes - but they were convinced.  \n\nGood things about Lagerfields - 1) Full menu until 10pm.  After 10 you can still get deserts and most of their appetizers.  In this part of town that's big.  2) Because they are a restaurant during the day, it's never hard to find a table.  Well, that and because the crowds just aren't packing it in over there... 3) It wasn't a bad time.  There was a decent cover band the night we went.  Between sets they played some muzak that was pretty cool for the crowd - we sang along to a few good 80's tunes together.  \n\nSo, is this your destination location?  Heck no.  But, if you're ever in the area, and you have a group of friends that you just want to sit and talk with while in a bar setting, it's not the worse option in the area.  \n\nAnd it beats the heck out of Village Inn.", "type": "review", "business_id": "77tMP3nG9TH0rrhf6G4g6A"}

Saturday night date- I picked where I wanted to go. Crap! MISTAKE #1.  IPIC  sucked once again and this is the 3rd time I was there! I don't mind spending my dates bucks on high  priced things to do and eat- nor my own money for that matter ,if it means I  get to stay  in my neighborhood-Scottsdale but this IPIC theater  is such a rip off in more ways than one..Here me out! Honestly!\nWe buy the tickets for $54.... and I head for the  bathroom.  A huge line of women in the bathroom (which is gorgeous) BUT--..there is NO toilet tissue in the stalls! The crappiest thing about that is- the women coming OUT of the stalls do NOT say a fking word to the ones waiting in line to use the stalls. Really? And they are smiling! nasty bitches- ya have to wonder now- how clean those fancy loungers really are now with them sitting their un-wiped ass's on the movie seats now. Ok- here is what happens next.  Theater #7, Saturday night ,Feb 25th, 9:30pm  show. We find our seats and once the movie starts- our seats are vibrating like someone is kicking them from behind! I keep looking around and no one is in back of me...then, I realize it's the sound system! Now that is annoying to have to sit in a seat that is vibrating- NOT the good vibrating way (naughty people)  but super annoying way...Ok, next-The sound system was so messed up in this theater that  it actually became an annoyance to sit thru the rest of the movie being tortured by the bad BROKEN sound system that shoots out a high pitch every 5 minutes. Warning too- People that  must drink vino and alcohol in the movies and eat in the movies, are FAT slobs. Just saying the truth. They were making noises, the waiters are getting in the way of the movie screen and they are all  talking loudly cause they are DRUNKEN ass holes- and  then- the smell of their drunken  farts from them stuffing foods in their pie holes and drinking during the movie is disgusting. Hello Cine Capri- here I come-never again to be in the IPIC itty bitty theater of human gas bombs- bringing my own toilet paper  and jiggling in the sticky chairs form the nasty women who didn't wipe their %$#@ in the bathroom.", "type": "review", "business_id": "3SlKa69UVN8KKYYPtlz1ew"}

(I did have a friend tell me that one time only...he was left waiting at his table but that as soon as the waiter & manager found out they went out of their way to make up for the oversite.) \n- Food - Let them bring the bread!!  Save your \"non-carb\" moment for another time!  YUM!  The spinach salad is wonderful and big enought to split especially at lunch. (besides...you have the bread!) I've had a couple steaks and the prime rib, the fish and even dessert.  I swear I've never had bad food here.  Always \"meets or exceeds\" expectations. \n- Beverages:  OK selection of wine (see happy hour below).  The do have some high end wineries on the menu but I find they have good standard wines and throw in a few \"odd balls\" that you don't normally see on a mid priced menu so try one of those.  They do also have a full bar.\n- Atmosphere - can be a bit loud.  Especially if people do not remove the screaming children.  :-(  \n- Happy Hour - definately do the patio.  When it's chilly they have heaters and a big fireplace.  The sliders are a complete meal!  They also do (I assume they still do) 1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays!!  \n\nSo...don't let the fact that it's a chain deter you.  Give them a try.

I'm not sure what else I can say about it. I'm an ASU alum and have spent many a night in here. The beer is great. the sandwiches are to die for (yes, that's an overstatement). The atmosphere is always festive and it's just pricey enough to keep most of the unwanted college riff raff out. \n\nThe Bad: Stay away from the hummus - yuk - tasted like a chili dog last time I had it. They constantly mess with the pasta salad. Last time I was there they used balsamic vinegar in it, which didn't taste bad, but it's grey. Grey!? What kind of food is grey? It's just hard to look at. Sometimes the staff and some patrons get a bit of an attitude, but it's a college bar. That's to be expected.", "type": "review", "business_id": "JokKtdXU7zXHcr20Lrk29A"}

This one perhaps even better than my old favorite.\n\nSee, I don't like to eat at sub joints that get their meats shipped in boxes pre-sliced who knows when. Port of Subs was one of the few that cut the meat when you ordered. I'll miss that, but Silver Mine is close. They slice the meat fresh all day as part of the shifts. That means it's still very fresh. The quality of their meats and bread is great as well. Their bread is especially good. \n\nThe restaurant is clean - immaculate even. The employees are all really nice dudes. So friendly, I doubt they're even from here. They must be from the Midwest. \n\nThis place would probably deserve four stars like any other good sub joint should, but what sets this place apart is that they deliver until 3am. That's right - not only does this place deliver sandwiches, they're open until 3 mother-frenchin a-to the-m. \n\nTheir brownies are 430 calories and they worth - they worth hard. They carry a great selection of chips and bev, and since they are relatively new on the scene - they seem to be constantly tweaking the business here and there. Their menus get revised every time I order from them. They give away scratch cards that usually give you a free delivery or a free small side item or drink or something. I have yet to win a car or my own franchise, but they popped up all over town at some point recently. \n\nIf I did win my own sub shop, I'd change the tag line to \"You can't beat our meat\" because that's what the people would want.\n\nSeriously, these guys are cool and the food is good.", "type": "review", "business_id": "f9xITzdfPbqQUoBxmSNymQ"}
